1. Add text files to folder named "recipes".
2. Compile FC_v3.cpp
3. Run parse_recipe function from R script "food_enities_V2.R"
Important: Do not modify the folder structure, since the output paths are hardcoded.

N.B. There are currently issues with the API for the UCREL Semantic Tagger. Currently waiting feedback so this can be resolved.
