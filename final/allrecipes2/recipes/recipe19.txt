Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease the cups of a muffin pan.    
In a large heavy skillet over medium heat, cook beef until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. Stir in barbeque sauce and dried onion. Simmer for a few minutes over low heat.    
Flatten each biscuit, and press into cups of the prepared muffin pan. Make sure the dough comes to the top of the pan. Spoon a portion of the meat mixture into each dough cup.    
Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese, and bake for 3 more minutes.
