Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
In a bowl, mix the mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip chicken into the mayonnaise mixture, then into the bread crumbs to coat. Arrange coated chicken on a baking sheet.    
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear and coating is golden brown.
