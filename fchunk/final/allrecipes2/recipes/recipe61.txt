Mix flour and Creole seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken through the flour mixture, shaking of excess.    
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook chicken in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, pickles, vinegar, capers, and garlic to chicken; simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more.
