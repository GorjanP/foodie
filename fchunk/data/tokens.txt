Called
'siu
mai'
,
these
are
open-wrapped
steamed
pork
and
prawn
dumplings
that
can
be
found
in
all
the
dim
sum
restaurants
in
Hong
Kong
and
across
the
world
.
They
are
sometimes
made
with
a
pork
and
mushroom
filling
and
topped
with
a
red
wolfberry
(
otherwise
known
as
goji
berry
)
.
However
,
my
favourite
has
to
be
with
the
pork
and
prawn
filling
.
The
prawns
are
roughly
diced
so
that
when
they
are
cooked
you
can
detect
a
'bite'
from
them
.
This
is
another
of
my
all-time
favourite
dim
sum
snacks
and
great
to
serve
at
a
dinner
party
as
a
starter
with
some
chilli
or
soy
dipping
sauces
of
your
choice
.
For
the
filling
:
mix
the
pork
,
prawns
,
onion
,
ginger
,
soy
sauce
rice
wine
,
cornstarch
,
sesame
oil
,
salt
,
and
pepper
in
a
bowl
.
Stir
to
combine
the
ingredients
.
For
the
dumplings
:
take
one
wonton
wrapper
and
place
two
teaspoons
of
the
filling
in
the
center
.
Then
,
gather
up
the
sides
of
the
wrapper
and
mold
it
around
the
filling
into
a
ball-like
shape
,
leaving
the
center
exposed
.
(
Cook
's
Note
:
Ensure
you
pinch
the
wrapper
around
the
filling
firmly
.
To
help
,
you
can
brush
the
wonton
wrapper
with
egg
wash
to
prevent
wrappers
from
opening
up
and
separating
from
the
filling
once
cooked
.
)
Top
each
dumpling
with
a
Goji
berry
,
if
using
.
Oil
the
bottom
of
a
bamboo
steamer
and
line
it
with
greaseproof
or
parchment
paper
.
Arrange
the
dumplings
in
the
steamer
,
cover
with
a
lid
and
place
it
over
a
pan
of
boiling
water
,
making
sure
the
water
does
not
touch
the
base
of
the
steamer
.
Steam
the
dumplings
for
six
to
eight
minutes
,
or
until
cooked
.
Meanwhile
,
combine
the
chilli
and
soy
sauce
into
a
bowl
.
Serve
alongside
the
dumplings
.
