Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside. Wrap the tortillas in foil and warm in the oven.    
Fry the eggs in a greased skillet until firm. In a small sauce pan heat the refried beans.    
Top each tortilla with refried beans, 2 strips of bacon, 1 egg and a little cheese.  Roll tortillas into burritos and serve.
