Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.    
Unroll crescent rolls into the prepared dish, pinching the seams together.    
Beat cream cheese, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; spread over crescent roll dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon over cream cheese mixture layer.    
Pour cherry pie filling over brown sugar layer. Sprinkle yellow cake mix over cherry pie filling. Arrange butter slices over cake mix and top with remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Wrap a piece of aluminum foil under baking dish to help prevent rolls from burning.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
