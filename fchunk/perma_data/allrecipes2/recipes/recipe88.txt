Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving 1 inch of parchment hanging over the sides.    
Mix oats, figs, almonds, and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds together in a bowl.    
Stir bananas, peanut butter, and honey together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until completely melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.    
Whisk egg whites together in a bowl until foamy. Mix banana mixture into egg whites and whisk until smooth; add oat mixture and stir until batter well combined. Fold blueberries into batter. Press batter into the prepared pan; top with flax seeds and 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
