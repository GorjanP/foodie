Mix together brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic and hot sauce in a small bowl.   
Lightly salt and pepper the chicken strips.   
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken strips and brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Simmer uncovered until the sauce thickens, 8 to 10 minutes.
