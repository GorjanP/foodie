Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.    
Combine flour, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, salt, and baking soda in a bowl; mix in almond milk, quinoa, and molasses. Spread into the prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
