Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat and grease with butter.    
Whisk eggs, yogurt, water, coconut flour, coconut oil, flaxseed meal, vanilla extract, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and stevia together in a large bowl.    
Drop batter into the hot skillet using a 1/3 cup measuring cup. Cook until bubbles form and the pancakes are firm enough to flip, 4 to 5 minutes. Be sure to cook them on low enough heat that the outside doesn't burn before the inside is done. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and done in the middle, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
