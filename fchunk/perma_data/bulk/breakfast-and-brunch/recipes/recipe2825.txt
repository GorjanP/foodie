Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 1 large or 2 smaller baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Mix peanut butter, maple syrup, flaxseed meal, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add oats and coconut and mix until completely combined. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add pumpkin seeds and stir the granola. Continue baking until evenly browned and dry to the touch, about 9 minutes more.    
Let granola cool slightly. Add raisins. Store granola in an airtight container.
