Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.    
Beat together eggs, oil, rum, and milk in a bowl.  Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl.  Mix the flour into the eggs until just moistened.  Gently fold in the pineapple, cherries, and coconut.  Pour into prepared pans.    
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes.  Let cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool on a wire rack.
