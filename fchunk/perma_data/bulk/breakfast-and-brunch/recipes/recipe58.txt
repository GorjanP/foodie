Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.    
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with crescent roll dough, and sprinkle with crumbled sausage. In a large bowl, mix beaten eggs, mozzarella, and Cheddar. Season the mixture with oregano, and pour over the sausage and crescent rolls.    
Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
