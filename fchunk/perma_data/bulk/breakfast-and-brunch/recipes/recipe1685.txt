Over medium-low heat melt butter in a large saucepan. Add bread cubes and toss to coat with butter. Stir in carrots, salt, parsley and chicken. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.    
Beat together eggs and milk; stir in cheese. Pour egg mixture over bread mixture and stir briefly to combine. Cook until eggs are set, about 10 to 15 minutes.
