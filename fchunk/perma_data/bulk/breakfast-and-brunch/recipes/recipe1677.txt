Transfer each container of yogurt into a muffin cup and freeze solid, about 4 hours. Remove frozen yogurt; place 1 portion of frozen yogurt into a resealable plastic bag and add 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/2 cup blueberries, and half a banana to each bag. Store the bags in the freezer until serving time. Place contents of a bag into a blender and blend until smooth.
