Heat heavy cream and butter in a small saucepan until barely simmering.    
Crack each egg into a small bowl.    
Slide one egg at a time into the heated cream mixture. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes on top. Cover and cook over low heat until white begins to set, about 2 minutes. Uncover and add shredded Cheddar cheese. Recover and cook until yolk is desired doneness, about 2 minutes more.    
Serve eggs and cream topped with scallions.
