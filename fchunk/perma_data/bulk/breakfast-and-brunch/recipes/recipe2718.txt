Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash on a baking sheet. Grease a pie dish.    
Bake squash in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool squash until able to touch, about 15 minutes; cut in half, remove seeds, and scoop meat into a bowl.    
Mix squash, onion, turkey, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour into prepared pie dish.    
Bake in the oven until edges become lighter in color and middle is set, 35 to 45 minutes.
