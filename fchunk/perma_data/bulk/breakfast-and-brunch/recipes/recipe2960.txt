Cook pork sirloin according to the directions on the package.    
For the hollandaise sauce: Whisk 3 egg yolks, 1 tablespoon milk and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a pan over medium heat.    
Slowly add 8 tablespoons melted butter while stirring vigorously until combined.    
For the poached eggs: Fill a sauce pan with three inches of simmering water. Carefully crack eggs into water and cook for 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.    
An egg poacher can also be used in place of this method to simplify things.    
Toast English muffins and top each one with a slice of pork sirloin, an egg and hollandaise sauce.
