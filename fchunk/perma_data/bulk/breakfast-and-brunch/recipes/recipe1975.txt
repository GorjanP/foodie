Heat oven to 375 degrees F.    
Cut tops off rolls; set aside. Make 1-inch-deep indentation in center of bottom half of each roll.    
Crumble 6 bacon slices; sprinkle into bread bowls. Top with VELVEETA. Crack egg over VELVEETA in each bowl; place on baking sheet.    
Bake 20 to 25 min. or until egg whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but do not become firm, adding tops of rolls, cut-sides up, to baking sheet for the last 5 min.    
Sprinkle eggs with chives. Replace tops of rolls. Serve with remaining bacon slices.
