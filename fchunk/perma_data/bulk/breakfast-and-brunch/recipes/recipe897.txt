In a large bowl, beat together eggs and milk. Stir in onion, ham, cheese, salt, pepper and garlic powder.    
Melt butter in a large frying pan or skillet over medium high heat. Add eggs and cook, without stirring, until eggs begin to set. At that point, stir the eggs until roughly scrambled.  Keep doing this until eggs are fully cooked, about 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm.
