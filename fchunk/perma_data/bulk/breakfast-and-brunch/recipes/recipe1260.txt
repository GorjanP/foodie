Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Add the onions, peppers, garlic, tomatoes, and potatoes. Season with salt and pepper and cook until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.    
Sprinkle vegetable mixture with cheese. Crack eggs into the pan a couple of inches apart. Cover pan and allow eggs to cook to desired firmness. Remove pan from heat and serve.
