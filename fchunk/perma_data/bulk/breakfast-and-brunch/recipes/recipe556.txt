In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and baking powder. Add the sourdough starter, oil, eggs and milk; beat well.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
