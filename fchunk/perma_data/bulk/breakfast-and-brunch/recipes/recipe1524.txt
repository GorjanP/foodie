In a microwave safe bowl, combine apple cider and oats. In a separate bowl, stir together butter, cider vinegar and cinnamon. Stir the two mixtures together and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Let cool to lukewarm.    
Stir together flour, baking powder, raisins and eggs. Blend flour mixture into oatmeal mixture.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
