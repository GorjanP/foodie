Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a muffin tin with oil.    
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and onion; saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.    
Line 8 muffin cups with 1 slice of ham each. Place a spoonful of mushroom mixture in each cup and crack 1 egg on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until egg whites are completely set, about 15 minutes. Top with black pepper.
