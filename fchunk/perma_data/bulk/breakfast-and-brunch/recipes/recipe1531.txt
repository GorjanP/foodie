Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.    
Cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until completely browned and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from skillet and slice. Set aside.    
Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with the crescent rolls. Spread the hash browns over the crescent roll, then layer with the sliced sausage. Beat the eggs with the milk in a bowl. Pour the egg mixture over the sausage.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the egg sets, about 50 minutes. Turn the oven off. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over the top and return to the oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Allow pie to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
