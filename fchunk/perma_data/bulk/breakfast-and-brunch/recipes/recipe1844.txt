Bring oats and heavy cream to a simmer in a pot over medium-high heat. Stir and cook for 1 minute and turn off the heat. Let cool down to room temperature, at least 10 minutes.    
Transfer oat mixture into a bowl. Add lemon zest and lemon juice. Drizzle in honey and crack in an egg. Add salt and baking soda. Mix thoroughly with a spatula. Stir in flour until no dry spots remain. Cover and let rest for at least 1 hour.    
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Scoop spoonfuls of the oat mixture into the hot skillet and flatten to your desired thickness. Cook until browned and tops spring back when touched, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
