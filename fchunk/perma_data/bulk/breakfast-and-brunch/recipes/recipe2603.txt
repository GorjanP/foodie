Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place crust on a pizza pan. Layer ham on top.    
Place pizza in the preheated oven until warm, about 10 minutes.    
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes.    
Remove the pizza from the oven; spread scrambled eggs on top.    
Whisk milk and hollandaise sauce mix together in a saucepan; add butter. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and simmer until thick, about 1 minute. Drizzle over the pizza. Cut into 8 slices.
