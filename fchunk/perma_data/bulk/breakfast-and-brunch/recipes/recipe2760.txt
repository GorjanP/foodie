Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place farmer's cheese in 1 bowl and mozzarella cheese in a separate bowl.    
Combine sausage, salami, and pepperoni in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir until warmed, about 5 minutes. Stir ricotta cheese into meat mixture until melted and stringy, about 5 minutes. Stir farmer's cheese and mozzarella cheese into meat mixture until warmed, about 5 minutes.    
Blend eggs together in a blender until frothy; pour into meat-cheese mixture and stir until some of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Pour egg mixture into a 9-inch pie pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top has risen and is starting to brown, about 20 minutes. Cool frittata on a wire rack until set, at least 5 minutes.
