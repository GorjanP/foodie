In a large bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, cocoa, ginger, cinnamon and cloves; stir in hazelnuts. Set aside.    
In a medium bowl whisk together milk, egg whites and molasses.    
Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour wet ingredients into it.  Stir just enough to moisten; batter will be lumpy.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
