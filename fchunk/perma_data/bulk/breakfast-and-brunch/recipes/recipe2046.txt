Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine sausage, baking mix, Cheddar cheese, egg, and evaporated milk in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix on low speed until thoroughly combined.    
Shape sausage mixture into 1-inch balls and arrange onto baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
