Combine apples, water, and orange juice in a small pot; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and cinnamon into apple mixture. Simmer, stirring frequently, until apples are light golden and most of the liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir maple syrup into apples and reduce heat to low.    
Beat flour, oats, milk, egg, coconut oil, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, sucralose, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until batter is just-combined.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-low heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve finished pancakes with hot apple-maple sauce.
