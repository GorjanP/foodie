Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl combine dry ingredients.  In another large mixing bowl combine eggs, oil and almond extract; whisk until combined. Stir in soy milk.  Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until combined.  Batter should be slightly thick, adjust liquid if necessary.    
Pour batter by the 1/4 cup full onto hot griddle.  Cook until edges look dry and bubbles burst. Flip and cook another minute or so until golden brown.  Serve warm.
