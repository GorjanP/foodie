Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pan.    
Soak raisins in apple juice.    
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, oats, and brown sugar.  Add applesauce, oil, eggs, and milk; stir until just combined.  Mix in raisins.  Spread batter into prepared pan.    
Bake for 55 to 60 minutes.   Remove from pan immediately, and cool on a wire rack.
