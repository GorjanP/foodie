Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.    
Mix all-purpose flour, rice flour, stevia powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.    
Beat bananas, almond milk, vegetable oil, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; fold in pine nuts and flax seeds. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
