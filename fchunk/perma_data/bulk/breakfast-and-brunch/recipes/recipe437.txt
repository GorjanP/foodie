Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 Degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.    
In a large bowl, beat together the sugars and sunflower oil.  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into the bowl while stirring occasionally.  Beat the eggs together, and gradually stir into the batter until everything is combined.  Mix in carrots, pecans, and vanilla until well combined.  Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake on middle rack for 60 minutes, or until it tests done.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto wire rack to cool completely.
