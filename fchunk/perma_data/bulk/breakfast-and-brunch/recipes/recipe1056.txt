Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Heat brown sugar, butter, and corn syrup in a saucepan over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish and sprinkle with pecans. Arrange apple slices over pecans. Layer bread slices over apple in two layers.    
Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt in a bowl; pour over bread and allow to set for 1 hour at room temperature or cover and refrigerate overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Uncover and bake in preheated oven until fluffy and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
