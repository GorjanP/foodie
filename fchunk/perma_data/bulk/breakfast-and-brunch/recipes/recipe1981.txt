Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Beat eggs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together thoroughly in a bowl.    
Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add cooked pasta; toss to coat in olive oil. Add beaten eggs, stir, and cook until eggs begin firming up on the sides of the skillet, about 3 minutes.    
Broil in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 2 to 3 minutes.
