Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.    
Spread bacon into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to cover. Spread potato nuggets over the bacon.    
Beat eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over the layer of potato nuggets. Top with Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until hot in the center, about 1 hour.
