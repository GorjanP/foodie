Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a pie plate with prepared pie pastry.    
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot skillet until onion is tender, 4 to 6 minutes.    
Stir mushrooms into onion mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms reduce in size and soften, 5 to 10 minutes. Add spinach to vegetable mixture; cook and stir until spinach wilts, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.    
Beat milk, eggs, Cajun seasoning, and salt together in a bowl.    
Spread vegetable mixture out into prepared pie plate; sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over vegetable mixture. Pour egg mixture over cheese and sprinkle feta cheese over the top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until quiche is set, 30 to 40 minutes.
