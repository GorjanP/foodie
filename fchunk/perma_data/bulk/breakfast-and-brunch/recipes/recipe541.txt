Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.    
Whisk whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.    
Stir mashed bananas, peanut butter, brown sugar, yogurt, egg, and canola oil thoroughly in a separate bowl.    
Stir the banana mixture into the dry ingredients until thoroughly combined; stir in chocolate chips.    
Spoon batter into the prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the loaf is lightly browned at the edges and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.    
Cool the bread in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes before removing bread to finish cooling on rack. Slice when cool.
