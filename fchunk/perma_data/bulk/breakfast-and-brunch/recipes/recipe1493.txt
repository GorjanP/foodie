In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, barbeque sauce, milk, dill, mustard powder and garlic.    
Melt butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture, and cook stirring frequently until eggs are scrambled and cooked through. Remove from heat, and sprinkle cheese over the top. Let stand for a minute to melt cheese, then serve immediately.
