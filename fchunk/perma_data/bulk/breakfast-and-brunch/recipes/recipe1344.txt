Prepare jasmine rice as directed on package.    
Prepare brown gravy mix as directed on package and keep warm.    
Divide ground beef into 4 servings and shape into patties.    
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Push onions to sides of skillet. Place burger patties in center of skillet. Pan fry until cooked throughout, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).    
Spray a separate skillet with non-stick cooking spray; set over medium-high heat. Cook eggs until set, and turn.    
Divide hot cooked rice into mounds on four plates. Sprinkle each mound with 1/4 of sauteed onions. Place 1 beef patty over each stack. Ladle gravy over ground beef patty. Place 1 over-easy egg over each patty/gravy. Enjoy!
