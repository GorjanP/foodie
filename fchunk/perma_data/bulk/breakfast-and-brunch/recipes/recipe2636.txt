Whisk soy milk, flour, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well beaten. Pour into a pie pan or other wide, shallow dish.    
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.    
Dip each slice of bread into the soy milk mixture and place into the skillet. Cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
