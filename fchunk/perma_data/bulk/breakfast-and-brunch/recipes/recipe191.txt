Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.  Add butter, eggs, nuts, and mashed banana. Beat until well blended.    
Pour batter into prepared pan and bake about 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean.
