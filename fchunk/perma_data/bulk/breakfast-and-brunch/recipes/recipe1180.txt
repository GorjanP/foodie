Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet and set aside to cool slightly.    
In a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Beat in the milk. Add the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix until just combined.  Add corn, cheese and melted butter from skillet and mix just until combined.    
Heat the same skillet over medium heat until hot. Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the hot skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve hot with syrup.
