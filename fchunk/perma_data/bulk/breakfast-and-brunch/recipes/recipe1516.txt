Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda, set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter or margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the orange juice, milk and egg; beat well. Gradually blend in the flour mixture. Stir in the apricots, chocolate chips and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
