Preheat oven to 350 F. Begin by mixing the eggs and heavy cream in a bowl with the salt & pepper.    
In a separate bowl place the sausage, jalapeno pepper, cheese, garlic and cumin.    
Now place a third of the amount of egg mixture in the bottom of a 2 quart baking dish. Next, place a slice of bread into the dish. Place 1/3 of the amount of sausage mixture from step 2 onto the slice of bread.    
Repeat steps 3 to 4 until last slice of bread is on top. Add the remaining 1/3 of sausage ingredients evenly across the top slice of bread. Bake in oven for 15 minutes.
