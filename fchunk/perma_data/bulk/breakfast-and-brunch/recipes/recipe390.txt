Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.    
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.    
In a large bowl, combine eggs, chiles, onion, garlic powder, salt pepper and sausage; mix well. Spoon 1/4 cup of sausage mixture into each prepared muffin cup.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until egg has set and a toothpick inserted into each 'muffin' comes out clean.
