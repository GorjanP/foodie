Sprinkle Cheddar cheese into a nonstick skillet over medium heat, forming a circular shape. Fry until cheese is bubbling and starts to brown around the edges, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle red pepper flakes over the cheese.    
Crack egg over the center. Poke the tip of your spatula through the egg white until some of it runs out and flattens over the pan. Cook until cheese is browned to your liking and egg white starts to set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Scrape up the sides using your spatula and fold them over the yolk. Continue cooking for a few seconds until egg is securely encased but still runny.    
Transfer onto toast and top with green onions. Break open the yolk and sprinkle salt on top.
