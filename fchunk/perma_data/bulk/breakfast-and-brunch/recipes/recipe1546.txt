Beat eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt together in a bowl.    
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, spinach, and cherry tomatoes; cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Pour egg mixture over vegetable mixture and cook until eggs are still soft and halfway cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese to egg mixture; cook until eggs are set and cheeses are melted, 3 to 4 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
