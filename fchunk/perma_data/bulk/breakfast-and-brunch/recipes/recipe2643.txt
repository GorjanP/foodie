Mix egg whites and paprika together in a bowl.    
Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg white mixture; cook for 1 minute. Place basil leaves over egg whites. Cook until egg white starts to firm up, about 1 minute. Spread avocado on top and sprinkle with feta cheese. Cook for 3 minutes more. Fold in half to form the omelet.
