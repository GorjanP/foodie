Microwave water until very hot, 3 to 4 minutes.    
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add prosciutto; saute until moisture evaporates and bits start to fry and crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove prosciutto; set aside.    
Add the hot water to the empty pan and bring to a boil. Whisk in grits and salt. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat until thick, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in prosciutto, cheese, butter and pepper to taste. Let stand to cool and allow flavors to blend, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve.
