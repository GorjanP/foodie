Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, flax seeds, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir coconut milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into flour mixture until batter is smooth.    
Heat a skillet over medium heat; add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, creating 4-inch circles, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
