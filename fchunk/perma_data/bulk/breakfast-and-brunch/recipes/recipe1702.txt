Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk coconut milk, egg, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into the flour mixture just until batter is combined.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
