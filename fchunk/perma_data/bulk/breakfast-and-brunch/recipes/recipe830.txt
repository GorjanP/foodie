Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prick bottom and sides of pie crust and bake 10 minutes, until lightly brown; set aside to cool.    
Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.    
In a bowl, mix eggs, milk, mustard and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, toss bacon with flour to lightly coat. Spread 3/4 bacon mixture and Swiss cheese over bottom of pie crust. Pour egg mixture over bacon mixture. Top with remaining bacon mixture.    
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before serving.
