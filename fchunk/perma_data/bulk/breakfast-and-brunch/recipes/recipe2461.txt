Fill a pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in sweet potato and return to a boil. Cook until sweet potato is tender, 7 to 10 minutes; drain.    
Mash sweet potato in a small bowl with a fork.    
Mix 1 cup mashed sweet potato, eggs, milk, oat flour, protein powder, flax seeds, pumpkin pie spice, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir in banana, almonds, pecans, and walnuts until batter is combined.    
Melt coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour enough batter into the skillet to create a 4- to 6-inch pancake. Cook, flipping once, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
