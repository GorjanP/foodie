Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Preheat waffle iron.    
In a bowl, mix the pancake mix and whole wheat flour. Form a well in the center, and pour in water, oil, and syrup. Stir until evenly moist. Stir in the milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. Fold in walnuts.    
Pour about 1/3 cup batter per waffle into the waffle iron, and cook 5 minutes, until done. Transfer waffles to a baking dish, and place in the preheated oven. Cook 5 minutes, or until crisp.
