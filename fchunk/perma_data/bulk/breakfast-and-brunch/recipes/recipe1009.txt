Lightly grease a microwave-safe 9x5 inch loaf pan; sprinkle pan with cornmeal.    
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add milk, sugar, salt, soda and whole wheat flour; beat well. Beat in all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth. Form into a loaf, and place into the prepared pan.    
Place in microwave oven uncovered, at 50 percent power, for 1 minute. Let rest for 10 minutes. Repeat 1 or 2 times until loaf has doubled in size.    
Microwave on high for 4 to 6 minutes, until top is no longer moist.  Let stand for 5 minutes in pan. Remove and cool on a rack.
