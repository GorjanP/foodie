Beat together the eggs, milk, orange juice, anise, and flour until smooth.  Refrigerate overnight.    
To cook the crepes, melt a little butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat; brush the butter evenly over the pan. Pour in 1/4 cup of the batter, tilt the pan to distribute the batter evenly.  Cook until the batter begins to firm up and bubble, when lightly browned, flip over, and continue cooking until browned on the other side, about 4 minutes total. Repeat with remaining batter. To serve, sprinkle crepes with sugar.
