Preheat and lightly grease a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and paprika together in a bowl. Stir buttermilk, butter, and egg together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just blended.    
Ladle 1/2 to 3/4 cup batter into the preheated waffle iron; cook waffle according to manufacturers' instructions until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
