Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix walnuts, pecans, coconut, and almonds together in a bowl.    
Stir cinnamon, erythritol, and sucralose into melted butter; pour over nut mixture and stir to coat. Spread granola in a single layer on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crunchy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven; stir and allow to cool.
