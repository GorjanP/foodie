Sift together the flour, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl. Slowly add the egg and milk while stirring continually until smooth.    
Place a skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat the surface of the skillet with butter. Pour 1/8 cup of batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to appear on the surface of the batter; flip and continue to cook until lightly browned on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes each side. Reapply butter to the skillet between batches.
