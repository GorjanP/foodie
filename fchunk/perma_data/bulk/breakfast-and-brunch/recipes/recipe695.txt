Mix oats and buttermilk in a bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes. Add eggs, butter, flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda; stir until blended.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
