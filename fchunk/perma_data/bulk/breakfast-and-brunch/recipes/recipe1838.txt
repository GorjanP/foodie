Combine milk, water, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring gently. Remove from heat. Pour in semolina flour in a steady stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.    
Place saucepan back over medium heat; whisk until porridge comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook until porridge thickens, about 20 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat; stir in sugar.    
Let porridge stand for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.
