Combine peanut butter, oil and honey in small saucepan. Heat on low until smooth and pourable. Meanwhile, process 1 cup of oats in blender or food processor until finely ground. Combine ground oats with remaining oats, sugar and salt in large bowl. Pour warm peanut butter mixture over oat mixture and stir well. Pour onto prepared baking sheet.
