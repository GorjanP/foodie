Mash half the banana in a saucepan. Whisk almond milk, honey, almond extract, cinnamon, and salt with the mashed banana until smooth; bring to a boil and stir oats into the mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until the oats are tender and the moisture has been absorbed to your desired consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer oatmeal to a bowl.    
Dice remaining banana half. Top oatmeal with banana and more cinnamon, as desired.
