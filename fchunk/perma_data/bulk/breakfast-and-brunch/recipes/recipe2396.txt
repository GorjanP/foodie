Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour four 16 ounce fruit or vegetable cans.    
In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.  Combine the eggs, oil, and milk; add to the sifted ingredients, and mix until just combined.  Stir in carrots, coconut, cherries, raisins, and pecans.    
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes.  Remove from cans, and cool thoroughly.  Wrap in plastic wrap or foil, and refrigerate to store.
