Whisk eggs lightly in a large bowl. Add applesauce and vanilla extract; mix to combine.    
Combine almond flour, tapioca flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to egg mixture; mix until just combined. Add water until batter is desired thickness. Set batter aside to rest for 15 minutes.    
Melt coconut oil on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
