Mix pizza sauce, pepperoni, tomato, onion, mushrooms, olives, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.    
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into the hot oil and cook until set, about 5 minutes. Pour pizza sauce mixture over eggs and cook until firm enough to fold 1 side of eggs over the filling creating an omelet, 5 to 10 minutes more.
