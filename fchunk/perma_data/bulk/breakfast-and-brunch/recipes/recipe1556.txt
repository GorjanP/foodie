Place shredded potatoes and apple in a clean kitchen towel. Gather towel on top and wring out excess liquid.    
Combine potatoes, apple, eggs, flour, and green onion in a bowl.    
Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy sauce pan over medium-high heat.    
Form mixture into palm-sized patties; fry in hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes on each side. More oil may be needed with each batch.    
Remove pancakes from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt.    
Serve pancakes topped with sour cream.
