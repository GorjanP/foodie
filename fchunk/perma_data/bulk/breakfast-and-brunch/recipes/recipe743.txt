Slice the loaf of French bread into about 25 slices, and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and maple syrup.    
Place enough bread slices in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover. Drop 2 teaspoons or so of cream cheese onto each slice. You do not need to spread the cheese. Repeat layering with bread slices and cream cheese until the dish is filled to the top. Slowly pour the egg mixture over the layers, so it doesn't run over the sides. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.    
The next morning, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Bake casserole for 45 minutes, or until set and golden brown.
