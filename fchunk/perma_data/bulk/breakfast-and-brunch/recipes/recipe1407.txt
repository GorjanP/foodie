Place all ingredients into bread machine in the proper order for your machine.  Use the Dough cycle.    
At end of the Dough cycle, remove dough from the machine.  Place on a lightly floured board, and let it rest, covered, for about 10 minutes.    
Shape dough into a loaf, and place it in a 9 x 5 inch greased bread pan.  Cover, and let rise for 45 minutes.    
Just before baking, brush the top of the dough with a little milk, and slash a line down the center.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from pan, and cool on a wire rack.
