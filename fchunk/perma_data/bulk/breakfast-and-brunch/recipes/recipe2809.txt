Toast bread in a toaster until medium brown, about 2 minutes. Spread each slice equally with barbeque sauce.    
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs in and fry on both sides, about 4 minutes.    
Place each fried egg on a piece of toast. Top each with 1/4 of an avocado. Sprinkle an equal amount of cheese on top of each toast.
