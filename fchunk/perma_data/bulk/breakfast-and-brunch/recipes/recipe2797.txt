Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk eggs and cheese together in a small bowl. Pour into the skillet; cook and stir until scrambled and set, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.    
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a separate pan. Add sausage, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and seasoned salt. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and sausage is browned, 5 to 8 minutes.    
Divide scrambled eggs between 2 bowls. Place sausage mixture over the eggs. Drizzle pan drippings on top. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the bowls to create a crust.
