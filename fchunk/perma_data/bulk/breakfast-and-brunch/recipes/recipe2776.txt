Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add vanilla, eggs, oil, fruits, nuts and coconut; mix well. Pour into 2 greased 8-1/2 x 4-1/2-inch loaf pans.    
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center of loaf comes out clean. Cool in pans 5 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely on wire racks. When loaves are cool, mix together ingredients for glaze and pour over loaves.
