In a medium bowl, beat together egg whites, 1/4 cup reduced-fat Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup salsa.    
In a medium non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, brown both sides of the tortilla. Remove from heat.    
In the same skillet over medium-high heat, scramble the egg white mixture until no longer runny.    
Top tortilla with the scrambled egg mixture, remaining cheese and remaining salsa. Season with salt and pepper.
