Mix whole milk and brown sugar in a large bowl.    
Beat eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice together in a separate bowl until the eggs are well beaten; add to the milk mixture and stir to dissolve the brown sugar.    
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.    
Set one slice of Texas toast into the milk mixture; let soak until moistened, about 10 seconds per side.    
Cook the dipped toast in the preheated skillet until bottom is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes; flip toast and continue to cook until the other side is browned, 3 to 5 minutes more. Repeat dipping and cooking with remaining bread slices.
