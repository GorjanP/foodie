Combine acai pulp, 2/3 of the banana, and 2 tablespoons of soy milk in a blender; blend until smooth, but still thick. Add more soy milk as needed; smoothie should have the consistency of frozen yogurt.    
Slice the remaining banana. Pour thick smoothie into a bowl and top with granola and sliced bananas.
