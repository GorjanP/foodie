Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved marinade from the artichoke hearts in a large skillet. Cook and stir green onions in hot marinade until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Stir cooked green onions, eggs, Cheddar cheese, saltine crackers, parsley, garlic, hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center is puffy and no longer moist, about 40 minutes; cool slightly before cutting into squares.
