Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the dates and water. Cook stirring occasionally until the mixture forms a thick paste. Remove from heat and set aside.    
In a large bowl, mix together the oats, walnuts, raisins, wheat germ, sunflower seeds, and coconut. Spread out in a thin layer onto a baking sheet. If your baking sheet is small, this can be done in batches.    
Bake for 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly toasted. Transfer the mixture back into the bowl, and mix in the date paste, apple juice concentrate, and oil. Return to the baking sheet and bake for an additional 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until lightly browned. Granola will become more crispy as it cools. Store in an airtight container.
