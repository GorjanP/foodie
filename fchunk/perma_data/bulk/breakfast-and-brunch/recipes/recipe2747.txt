Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and hazelnut liqueur together in a shallow bowl.    
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large skillet, tilting the skillet to assure complete coverage.    
Dip 2 slices brioche in the egg mixture, moistening both sides.    
Cook brioche in the hot skillet until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat process until all bread is cooked.    
Cut each slice of brioche into half on a bias. Sprinkle hazelnuts over the halves and top with maple syrup.
