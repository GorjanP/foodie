Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch baking pan.    
Unroll crescent roll dough and press into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle hash browns and mozzarella cheese over the crescent roll dough.    
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over potato-cheese layer. Top with Parmesan cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set in the middle and cheeses are melted, about 30 minutes.
