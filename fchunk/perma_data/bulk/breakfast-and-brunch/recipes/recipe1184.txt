Cream together butter or margarine, sugar, and salt.  Mix in egg.  Stir in bananas and milk.  Stir in flour and baking soda with a few swift strokes; do not overbeat.  Spread batter into a greased and floured 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.    
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
