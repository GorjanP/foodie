Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with coconut oil.    
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add cauliflower, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until cauliflower is slightly translucent and garlic and onions are soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Place in a bowl and let cool.    
Place cottage cheese, egg whites, hot sauce, parsley, oregano, and garlic powder in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour into the bowl of cauliflower mixture; mix completely. Spoon mixture evenly into the greased muffin cups and press down so pancakes are even and flat.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges and tops are golden and crispy, about 30 minutes.
