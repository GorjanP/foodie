Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; cook and stir until soft. Add the onion and bell pepper, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Make a clearing in the center of the skillet and pour in the eggs. Cook and stir to scramble. When the eggs are cooked, stir in the tomato sauce until everything is coated. Serve warm.
