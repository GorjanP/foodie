Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage and onion. Cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer sausage mixture to the prepared baking dish.    
Whisk together the eggs and milk. Stir in the nacho cheese soup and 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Pour egg mixture over the sausage, and top with the remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the eggs are set, about 30 minutes.
