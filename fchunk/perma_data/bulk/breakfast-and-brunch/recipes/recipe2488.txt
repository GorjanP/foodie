Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Run cauliflower through the food processor using the shredding blade to create cauliflower "rice".    
Heat avocado oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add cauliflower "rice" and garlic salt; cook and stir until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.    
Whisk egg whites, eggs, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl; pour over cauliflower mixture. Cook until eggs are mostly set, 5 to 7 minutes.    
Place skillet under the broiler until eggs are completely set, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
