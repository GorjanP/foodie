Beat egg and white sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in quark cheese, flour, vanilla sugar, and salt. Mix well until dough is thick and sticky.    
Divide dough into 5 to 6 portions. Form into balls and coat with some flour. Flatten slightly to form into discs (syrniki).    
Heat oil in skillet over medium-low heat. Add the syrniki; fry until browned, 5 minutes per side.
