Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Mix chestnut flour, white rice flour, potato starch, and baking powder together in a large bowl.    
Combine milk, egg yolk, vegetable oil, and honey in another bowl. Sift in flour mixture, whisking constantly to prevent lumps in the batter.    
Beat egg white in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until peaks form. Fold gently into batter until just combined.    
Pour batter onto preheated waffle iron and cook until golden brown per manufacturer's instructions, 3 to 5 minutes.
