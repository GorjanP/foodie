Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet in the preheating oven.    
Combine peach slices, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; gently toss to coat the peaches well.    
Beat eggs, milk, flour, vanilla extract, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl until batter well-combined but a little lumpy; pour into skillet. Top batter with the peach mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 20 minutes.
