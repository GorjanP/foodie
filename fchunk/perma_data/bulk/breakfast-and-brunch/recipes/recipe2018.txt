Grease an 8 x 5 inch loaf tin thoroughly.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a small bowl, beat the egg well.  Mix in milk and melted butter or shortening.    
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a mixing bowl.  Add sugar, nuts, raisins and orange rind; mix well.  Blend egg mixture into fruit and nut mixture until flour is just moistened.  Turn batter into greased loaf tin, and allow to stand for 20 minutes.    
Place pan in the center of the oven.  Bake for 55 to 60 minutes.  Turn bread out on wire rack, and cool for several hours before slicing.
