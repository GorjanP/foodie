Bring water to a boil in a pot. Add salt and cinnamon, stirring to evenly disperse the cinnamon. Stir in steel-cut oats and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes.    
Add blueberries and cranberries to the oats. Simmer until oats begin to reach desired consistency, about 5 minutes. Add pecans; simmer for 3 to 5 minutes more.    
Add 1 cup of the cooked oats to each Mason jar. Screw lids on loosely and let cool on the counter until lids pop, about 30 minutes. Tighten caps and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
