Combine oat bran, flour, granola, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl.    
Blend apple, banana, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth; mix into oat bran mixture until batter is well mixed. Gently fold blueberries into batter.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
