Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray iron with cooking spray.    
Mix sorghum flour, tapioca starch, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl.    
Beat chicken and duck egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.    
Beat egg yolks, almond milk, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Continue beating while gradually adding the flour mixture; blend until smooth. Fold the egg whites into the batter.    
Pour 2/3 cup batter onto preheated waffle iron. Cook until golden brown.
