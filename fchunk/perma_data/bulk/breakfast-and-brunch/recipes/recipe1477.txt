Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans.    
Mix the flour, salt, baking powder, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, white sugar, poppy seeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the vanilla, lemon and butter flavoring. Stir until just combined and pour the batter into the prepared pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour. Cool for 5 minutes then poke holes in the top of the bread with a meat fork and pour glaze over tops.    
To Make Glaze: Mix the orange juice, confectioner's sugar, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of the vanilla, butter and lemon flavorings. Use immediately to pour over the still warm loaves.
