Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Mix oats, milk, eggs, applesauce, brown sugar, butter, white sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until oats are evenly moistened; pour into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and just golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
