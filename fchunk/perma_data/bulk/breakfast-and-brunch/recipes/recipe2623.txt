Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.    
Whisk milk, eggs, and applesauce together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is smooth.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
