Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).   Grease and flour 3 - 1 pound coffee cans.    
Sift together the dry ingredients .    
Combine the vegetable oil, water, canned pumpkin and eggs.  Slowly add dry ingredients to egg mixture and mix until blended    
Evenly distribute the batter between the coffee cans.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean and top of bread is browned.  Cool bread in coffee cans on a rack for 15 minutes. Remove bread from cans by running a knife around the inside and turning can upside down to dislodge bread (should slide right out!).  Cool completely.
