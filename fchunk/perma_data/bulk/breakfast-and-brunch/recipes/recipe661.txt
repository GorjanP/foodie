Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Lightly grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans.    
Beat together 2 tablespoons of softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl until fluffy.  Slowly beat in sugar until well incorporated.  Add the egg and mix well.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.  In a different bowl, mix together the bananas, milk, 2 tablespoons rum, lime zest, lime juice, and vanilla extract; stir well.  Pour 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter and mix well.  Mix in 1/2 of the mashed bananas.  Continue with another 1/3 of the flour, followed by the remaining banana mixture, and finally the remaining flour.  Fold in 1/4 cup pecans and 1/4 cup coconut flakes.    
Pour the mixture into the loaf pans, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about one hour.  When finished, cool for 10 minutes in the pan, remove, and finish cooling on a wire rack.    
After you take the banana bread out of the oven, prepare the topping by stirring together the brown sugar, remaining butter, lime juice, and 2 teaspoons of rum in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring to a simmer stirring constantly; cook until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth, about one minute.  Remove from heat, and stir in 2 tablespoons pecans, and 2 tablespoons coconut.  Spoon this topping over the loaves while they are still warm.  The topping will harden slightly when the loaf cools.
