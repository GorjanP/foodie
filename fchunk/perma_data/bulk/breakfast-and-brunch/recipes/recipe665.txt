Cook sausage in large nonstick skillet over medium heat 4-5 minutes or until hot.  Stir in potatoes.    
Beat eggs, cheese, salt and pepper in large bowl with wire whisk.  Pour over sausage mixture.    
Cook over medium-high heat 2 minutes, occasionally lifting edge with spatula and tilting skillet to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath.  (Do not stir.)    
Reduce heat to medium-low; cover.  Cook 14-17 minutes or until eggs are set.    
Top with tomato and onions.  Cut into 8 wedges to serve.
