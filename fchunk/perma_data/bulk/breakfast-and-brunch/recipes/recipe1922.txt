Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the puff pastry sheet into an 8-inch round or square pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottom of the pastry is very lightly browned, about 10 minutes.    
Mix together the chicken, 4 chopped plums, chicken broth, mace, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture over the partially-baked crust, and arrange slices of 2 plums over the top. Drizzle the pie with melted butter, and sprinkle with brown sugar.    
Bake the pie in the oven until the crust is golden brown and the plum slices have caramelized, about 40 minutes.
