Heat a saucepan over medium-low heat; add almond milk, ground flaxseed, and egg whites. Cook mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.    
Reduce heat to low and stir in applesauce, zucchini, and cinnamon. Cook and stir mixture until desired consistency is reached, 5 to 10 minutes more.
