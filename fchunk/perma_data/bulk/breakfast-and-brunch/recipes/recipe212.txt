Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.    
In a large bowl, combine eggs, cottage cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, chile peppers and bacon. Cover and refrigerate overnight.    
The next morning, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Remove cheese mixture from refrigerator; stir in flour, butter, baking powder and salt. Spoon batter into 24 lightly greased muffin cups.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until puffs are slightly golden on top.
