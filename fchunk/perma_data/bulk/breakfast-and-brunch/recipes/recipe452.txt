Bake biscuits according to package directions.    
Cook the bacon in a deep skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel lined plate and keep the grease in the pan. Gradually stir in the flour so that no lumps form, then mix in the milk, continuing to cook and stir until thickened. Crumble the bacon into the gravy and season with salt and pepper before serving.    
Split biscuits in half, top with gravy, and enjoy!
