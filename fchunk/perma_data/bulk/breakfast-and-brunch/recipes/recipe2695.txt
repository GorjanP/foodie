In medium non-stick skillet, heat oil over medium heat; saute red and jalapeno peppers and garlic for 2 minutes or until softened. Add ham and chili powder; saute 2 minutes or until heated through. Remove to bowl; cover to keep warm.    
In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk eggs, salt and pepper.    
Melt butter in the same skillet on medium heat; add eggs and cook, stirring gently, until set but still soft, about 2 minutes.    
Spoon eggs on each tortilla, top with ham mixture, cheese and onion. Serve with salsa and/or coriander, if desired.
