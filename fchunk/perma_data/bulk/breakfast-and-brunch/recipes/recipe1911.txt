Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.    
Beat eggs, bacon, mozzarella cheese, milk, flour, garlic, parsley, and thyme together in a bowl until evenly combined.    
Arrange 1/2 of the spinach in the bottom of the pie crust; sprinkle artichoke hearts over spinach layer. Pour egg mixture over artichoke hearts. Layer the remaining spinach over egg mixture; top with tomato slices.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the quiche comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
