Combine the cider, apple chunks, and cinnamon sticks in a large kettle and bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn the heat down to low and add the mace, anise seed, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and brown sugar.  Stir to combine, and simmer for 20 minutes until the spices have developed their flavor.    
Drop in the orange and lemon slices, simmer for 5 more minutes, and turn off the heat.  Ladle the wassail punch into mugs and serve hot. Include a few pieces of cooked apple or a cooked orange or lemon slice in each mug.
