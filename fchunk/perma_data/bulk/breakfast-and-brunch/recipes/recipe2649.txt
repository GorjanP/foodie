Combine cream cheese, eggs, sugar, and cinnamon in a blender; blend until smooth. Let rest 2 minutes or lightly tap on counter to remove bubbles.    
Heat a skillet over medium heat and grease with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 of the batter into the skillet; cook until bubbles start to form, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer to a clean plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
