Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Puree the bananas and dates in a food processor. Add the brown sugar, hot water, vanilla and cinnamon; mix well.    
Pour mixture into a large mixing bowl, add oatmeal and mix well.    
Spread onto large baking sheets and bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours stirring frequently. Cook longer for crunchier if desired.  Once cooled add the dried fruits and nuts, as little or as much as you want, and mix.
