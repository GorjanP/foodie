In a large skillet, stir together the water, garlic, and paprika. Separate the bacon slices, and place in the skillet. Turn the heat to high. The water will evaporate leaving the bacon coated with the garlic and paprika. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and continue to fry to your desired crispness, turning as needed.
