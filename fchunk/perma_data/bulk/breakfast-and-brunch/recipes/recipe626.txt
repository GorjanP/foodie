Whisk together the eggs, cream, cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon salt, and black pepper in a large bowl.  In a paper bag, shake together the flour, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon salt.    
Dip the chicken into the beaten egg mixture, then place into the flour mixture and shake to coat.  Place the breaded chicken onto a wire rack; do not stack. Let the chicken rest for 20 minutes to allow the coating to set.    
Heat about 3 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In small batches, fry chicken 5 to 8 minutes until golden brown. Remove chicken, and drain on paper towels. Set aside or keep warm in a a low oven.    
Combine the mayonnaise, maple syrup, horseradish, and mustard powder in a medium bowl. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.    
To assemble the sandwiches: Place 4 waffles on a cookie sheet, top each waffle with 2 chicken tenders, 3 slices of bacon, and 2 slices of Cheddar.  Broil the sandwich for a 3 to 5 minutes until the cheese melts.  Spread 3 tablespoons of the maple mayonnaise on the remaining 4 waffles and place on top of the sandwich.
