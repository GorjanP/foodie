Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease six (6 ounce) ramekins.    
In a medium bowl, toss together the ham, Cheddar cheese, bell pepper, and onion. Stir in the milk, cracker crumbs, and egg yolks. In a separate bowl, whip egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff. Fold into the ham and cheese mixture. Spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet.    
Bake for 40 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until puffed and golden. Prepare the mushroom sauce according to package directions.    
When the puffs are done, turn them out onto serving plates, and top with mushroom sauce.
