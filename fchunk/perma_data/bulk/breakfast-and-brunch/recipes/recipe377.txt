Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour two 8x4 inch pans.    
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in the banana and sour cream.    
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and pecans; stir into banana mixture, just until combined. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a loaf comes out clean. Remove from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cold.
