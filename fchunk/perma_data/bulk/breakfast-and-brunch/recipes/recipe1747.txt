Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Fit pie crust into a pie dish and prick the bottom of the crust with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until crust is golden, 8 to 10 more minutes.    
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes; drain. Place half the zucchini mixture in the crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.    
Combine ricotta cheese, half-and-half, eggs, salt, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and pepper in a large bowl. Pour ricotta mixture into crust, top with remaining zucchini mixture and sprinkle with paprika.    
Bake quiche in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
