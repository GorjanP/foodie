In medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in oats. Cook uncovered over medium heat, 1 minute for Quick Oats, 5 minutes for Old Fashioned Oats, stirring occasionally.    
Place berries, chia seeds, cinnamon, and ginger into blender or food processor container. Process until fruits are pureed. If mixture seems too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time to reach desired consistency. Swirl into bowl of cooked oats. Serve topped with yogurt, coconut, and honey.
