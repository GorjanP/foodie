In a large bowl, stir together wheat flour, buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, oats, and baking powder. Stir in milk, oil, honey, and egg.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides, and serve hot.
