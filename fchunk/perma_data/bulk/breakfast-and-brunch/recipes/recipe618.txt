Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Press pie pasty into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate.    
Bake pie crust in preheated oven for 5 minutes, use a fork to poke holes into the crust, and continue cooking until lightly browned, about 5 minutes more.    
Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and 1 tablespoon flour in a bowl; spread over the warm pie crust.    
Stir ham and honey mustard together in a bowl to coat the ham completely; spoon over the cheese mixture.    
Mix half-and-half, eggs, green onions, 1 tablespoon flour, and salt together in bowl. Pour mixture carefully over the ham layer; top with remaining Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in preheated oven until set in the center, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before cutting.
