In large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, melted butter, flour sugar and salt until smooth.    
Heat a medium-sized skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Grease pan with a small amount of butter or oil applied with a brush or paper towel.  Using a serving spoon or small ladle, spoon about 3 tablespoons crepe batter into hot pan, tilting the pan so that bottom surface is evenly coated.  Cook over medium heat, 1 to 2 minutes on a side, or until golden brown.  Serve immediately.
