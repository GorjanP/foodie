Combine baking soda with the boiling water.  Soak the dates in the water and baking soda solution for 30 minutes.    
Cream sugar and butter together.  Add eggs, vanilla, dates, nuts, flour, and salt.    
Divide batter equally between two 9 x 5 (or 8 1/2 x 4 1/2) inch greased loaf pans.  Bake 1 hour at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) (or until loaf tests done).   Can be frozen when cool.
