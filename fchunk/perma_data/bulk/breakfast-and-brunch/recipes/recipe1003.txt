Heat the sunflower seed oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the tomatoes, and evenly coat in the oil. Mix in the tomato paste, and season with cumin, allspice, and salt. Cover, and cook until the tomatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.    
Pour the eggs over the tomato mixture. Cover, and continue cooking 10 minutes, or until the eggs are no longer runny.
