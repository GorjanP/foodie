Lightly grease a 9 x 5 inch glass loaf pan, and line with greased waxed paper.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 Degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together butter or margarine, sugar, and almond extract.  Separate eggs, and beat in egg yolks one at a time until light and fluffy.  Sift flour, baking powder and soda into creamed mixture, and mix thoroughly. Stir in 1/4 cup strawberry juice. Fold in strawberries.    
In another bowl, beat egg whites until stiff.  Fold into strawberry batter. Turn batter into prepared pan.  Lightly drop pan to pop any air bubbles.    
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool for 15 minutes in the pan, and then cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
