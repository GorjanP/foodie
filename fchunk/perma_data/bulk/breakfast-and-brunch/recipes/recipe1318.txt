Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Toss tomatoes and parsley in vinaigrette. Drain and set aside.    
Beat eggs in a bowl; whisk in yogurt and milk. Pour egg mixture into prepared baking dish. Evenly distribute the tomatoes, bacon, chicken, avocados, and blue cheese on the egg mixture. Sprinkle with chives. Season with salt and pepper.    
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until eggs are cooked through, puffy, and beginning to brown.
