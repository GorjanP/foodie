Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 24 miniature muffin cups with cooking spray.    
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir spinach into onion and cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted and onions are translucent, about 3 more minutes. Drain juice.    
Beat eggs with milk in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; stir in Cheddar, Asiago, and Parmesan cheeses and season with salt and black pepper.    
Divide spinach mixture into the prepared muffin cups (about 1 teaspoon per cup) and top spinach with imitation crab meat. Slowly and carefully pour egg-cheese mixture over the imitation crab, filling the mini muffin cups just to the top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the egg is set, 12 to 15 minutes.
