Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan.    
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.    
Lightly beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl; stir in tomatoes with green chile peppers and half the Mexican cheese blend.    
Spread refried beans evenly across the bottom of the pie crust; layer chorizo onto refried beans. Pour egg mixture over chorizo layer; top with remaining Mexican cheese blend.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the middle of the quiche comes out clean and cheese is lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 15 minutes before serving.
