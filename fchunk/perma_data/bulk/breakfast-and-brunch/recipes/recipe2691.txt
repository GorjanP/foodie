Heat truffle (or olive) oil in a non-stick 8-inch pan.    
Beat the eggs in a bowl until fluffy; pour into pan and let cook until the sides set.    
Push the sides slightly toward the center and let the uncooked egg fill the edges. Repeat until the omelette is set.    
Add the cheese to one side of the omelette. Fold the omelette in half over the cheese and slide it onto a plate.    
Shave truffles on top.
