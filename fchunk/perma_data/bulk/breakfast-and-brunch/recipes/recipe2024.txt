Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.    
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, and sucralose sweetener in another bowl until light and fluffy. Beat  eggs, vanilla extract, and lemon juice into butter mixture until well combined.    
Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until smooth. Add yogurt, bananas, 1/2 cup walnuts, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, stirring until batter is just blended. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon walnuts and 1 tablespoon chocolate chips on top of batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
