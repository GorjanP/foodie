Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Place each avocado half in a ramekin. Crack 1 egg into each avocado half; season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Place ramekins on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until entire egg is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle each avocado with bacon and chives.
