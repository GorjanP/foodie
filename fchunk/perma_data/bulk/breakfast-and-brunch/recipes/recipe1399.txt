Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Mix potatoes, bacon, butter, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a 8x8-inch pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Pour eggs over potato mixture; season with oregano. Stir gently to incorporate.    
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese; bake until cheese is melted, about 2 more minutes.
