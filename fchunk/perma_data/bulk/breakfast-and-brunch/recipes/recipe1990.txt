Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
Place a cast iron skillet in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.    
Whisk 3 eggs together in a bowl until well blended and frothy. Add milk and 2 tablespoons melted butter; mix well. Stir in flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and blend until batter is smooth.    
Place 1 tablespoon butter in the hot skillet and swirl until bottom is evenly coated and butter is melted. Pour batter into the skillet and place immediately in the oven.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and pancake is inflated, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; crack 4 eggs into skillet. Cook until desired doneness is reached, 2 to 3 minutes per side.    
Mix ricotta cheese, salt, and pepper, together in a bowl.    
Cut pancake into 4 pieces and top each with a fried egg, ham, ricotta cheese, and Parmesan shavings.
