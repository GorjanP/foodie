Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Press the pie crust ito a 9-inch pie plate; set aside.    
Place broccoli in a glass bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Cook broccoli in microwave in 1-minute intervals until evenly heated through, about 5 minutes total; set aside.    
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in melted butter until slightly translucent, about 5 minutes.    
Stir ham and broccoli into the onion mixture and transfer to the pie crust.    
Beat Cheddar cheese, milk, eggs, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over the ham mixture. Sprinkle paprika over the entire quiche.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes.
