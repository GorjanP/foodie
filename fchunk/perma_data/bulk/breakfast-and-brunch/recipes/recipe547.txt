Whisk the eggs and milk together in a bowl. Spread the crushed corn flakes onto a plate.    
Dip each piece of bread into the egg mixture and then press gently into the cereal, turning to coat completely. Place the breadsticks onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.    
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook the coated breadsticks in the melted butter until golden, about 4 minutes each side.
