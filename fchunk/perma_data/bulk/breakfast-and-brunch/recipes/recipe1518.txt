In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.    
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add yeast mixture and buttermilk; mix well until dough pulls together. Dough will be somewhat soft. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight.    
The next morning, or when you are ready to bake your bread, take out your dough and knead in a little flour. Let dough sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Press out dough onto a lightly floured surface to a rectangle. Brush the surface with melted butter and sprinkle with the sugar, cinnamon and raisins. Roll up dough and place, seam down, on a lightly greased baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
