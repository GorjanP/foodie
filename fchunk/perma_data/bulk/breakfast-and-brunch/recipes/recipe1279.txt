Spray or lightly grease a large skillet and heat over medium heat.    
Crack 3 eggs into a glass measuring cup and beat with a fork or whisk until scrambled. Pour eggs into heated skillet, swirling the pan to coat the bottom. Cover and let cook until eggs are firm, about 2 minutes.    
Top with 1/4 each of the chopped ham, turkey, green onions, tomato, parsley, green bell pepper, and Cheddar cheese. Fold egg in half over fillings, and serve warm. Repeat with remaining ingredients for 4 omelets.
