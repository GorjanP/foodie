Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove bacon from the pan, and reserve the grease.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder. Stir in potatoes to make a sticky dough.    
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Squeeze the potato mixture into 6 or 7 dumplings, or your desired size. Drop carefully into the boiling water. Simmer for 45 to 60 minutes. Remove to a platter with a slotted spoon.    
Serve with bacon grease brushed over the top, and crumbled bacon. These may also be sliced and fried the next day for another great meal.
