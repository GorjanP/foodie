Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon from pan, drain and crumble; leave grease in pan.    
Heat bacon grease over medium heat and stir in butter. Add onion and potatoes. Cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown.    
Crack eggs on top of potatoes and stir gently to combine. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, cheese and bacon. Continue cooking until eggs are firm and cheese is melted.
