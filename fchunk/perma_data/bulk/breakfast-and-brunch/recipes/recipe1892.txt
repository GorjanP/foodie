Stir potatoes, onion, eggs, flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.    
Heat a lightly oiled large skillet over medium heat. Drop potato mixture by large spoonfuls onto the skillet and cook until edges are dry and golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining potato mixture.
