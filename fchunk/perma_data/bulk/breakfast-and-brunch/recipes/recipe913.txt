Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, stir together the oats, brown sugar, salt and baking powder. In a separate medium bowl, stir together the eggs, milk, vanilla and canola oil. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until well blended. Spoon into the prepared baking pan, and spread evenly. Sprinkle walnuts over the top.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
