Combine buttermilk, flour, sugar, farina, oil, egg, vanilla extract, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat using an electric mixer on low until just combined.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-low heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until middle is set, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
