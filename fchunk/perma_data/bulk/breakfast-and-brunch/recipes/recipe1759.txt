Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.    
Beat pumpkin puree, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl; add flour and beat until batter forms. Fold chocolate chips into batter; divide between the 2 prepared loaf pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool bread in pans for 15 minutes before removing.
