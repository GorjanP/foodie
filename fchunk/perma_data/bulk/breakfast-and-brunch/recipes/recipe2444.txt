Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place shells on a baking sheet and prick holes in the bottom of the shells with a fork.    
Whisk eggs, milk, and black pepper together in a mixing bowl until well blended.    
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add corned beef hash; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.    
Spoon 1 tablespoon of the corned beef hash into the bottom of each shell. Divide spinach among the shells; top with shredded cheese. Slowly pour egg mixture into the shells.    
Bake in preheated oven until eggs are set, about 15 minutes.
