Cook sausages according to package directions; cut into 1/4-inch slices; set aside.  In a skillet, saute onion and bell pepper in oil until almost tender.  Stir in garlic and chili pepper; cook for 1 additional minute.  Add sausage and chilies; set aside.  In a bowl, combine cheeses, green onion and cilantro.    
In a greased, 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, sprinkle one third of tortilla chips.  Follow with one-half of the sausage mixture and one-half of the cheese mixture; repeat.  In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper sauce; pour over layered ingredients.  Sprinkle with remaining tortilla chips.    
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 to 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
