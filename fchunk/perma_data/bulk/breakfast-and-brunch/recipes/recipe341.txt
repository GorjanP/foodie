In a large bowl, stir together  potatoes, eggs, onion, flour, salt and pepper.    
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Drop large spoonfuls of the potato batter into the skillet and flatten cakes slightly with a spatula. Cook for about 4 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Serve immediately.
