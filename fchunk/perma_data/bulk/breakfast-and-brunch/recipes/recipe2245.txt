Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish with cooking spray.    
Combine applesauce and oatmeal in a bowl; mix until evenly moistened. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer sticky, about 10 minutes.    
Flip applesauce oatmeal onto a work surface. Cut into bite-size squares and allow to cool.
