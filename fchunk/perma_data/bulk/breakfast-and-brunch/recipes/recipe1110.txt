Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 8-inch square oven-safe baking dish with cooking spray.    
In large bowl, combine oats and granulated sugar.    
In medium bowl, combine milk, egg substitute and vanilla; mix well. Add to oat mixture; mix well. Pour into prepared baking dish.    
Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until center jiggles slightly. Remove from oven to cooling rack.    
Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over top of oatmeal. Using back of spoon, gently spread sugar into a thin layer across entire surface of oatmeal.    
Return to oven; bake just until sugar melts, about 2 to 3 minutes.    
Set oven to broil. Broil 3 inches from heat until sugar bubbles and browns slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. (Watch carefully to prevent burning. It may be necessary to turn baking dish.) Spoon into bowls to serve.
