Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut bread slices in half diagonally, and arrange around edge of 9-inch pie plate.    
In a medium skillet, melt butter and saute zucchini until tender, about 3-5 minutes.  Add tomato and oregano, and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the flour, and spoon mixture into center of the bread-lined pie plate.    
In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, eggs, yogurt, and 1/2 the Parmesan cheese.  Spoon this mixture over the vegetables in the pie plate, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.    
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm in center.
