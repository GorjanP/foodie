Lightly whisk the eggs with the milk in a bowl to break the yolks and integrate the milk; season with 4 pinches black pepper and 2 pinches garlic salt.    
Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and onion in hot oil until the onion softens, about 5 minutes.    
Spread the mushrooms and onion into the bottom of the skillet so it forms an even layer.    
Sprinkle spinach evenly across the top of the mushroom and onion layer.    
Pour egg mixture over the vegetables.    
Cook until the top of the egg is set, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Sprinkle Stilton cheese and mozzarella cheese over the cooked egg; cook until the mozzarella begins to melt, fold the omelet in half around the filling to make a half-moon.
