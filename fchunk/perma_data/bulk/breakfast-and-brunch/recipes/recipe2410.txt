Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch cast-iron skillet, and place it in the oven while it preheats.    
In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs, cheese, corn and jalapeno peppers. Stir in the croutons until well coated. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden brown. Cut in to wedges or squares to serve.
