Place buckwheat groats in a bowl. Pour boiling water over groats and set aside for groats to absorb water, about 10 minutes. Retain water if it doesn't all absorb.    
Heat a skillet over medium heat.    
Whisk flour, coconut, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Beat milk, egg, oil, and honey together in a third bowl. Stir buckwheat groats mixture and flour mixture into milk mixture until just combined.    
Spray skillet with cooking spray. Pour batter, 1/4 to 1/3 cup per pancake, into heated skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
