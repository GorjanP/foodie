Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Whisk eggs with sugar and vanilla until fluffy. Add in Shamrock Farms Premium Sour Cream and whisk briefly. Add in flour, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk briefly. Pour in milk slowly, whisking until incorporated. Batter may be lumpy. Add up to 1/4 cup milk if it is too thick. It should be a thick batter, not watery or soupy, but should definitely be sticky and pourable.    
Pour 1/8 of the batter into a waffle iron and cook to desired darkness. Repeat with remaining batter. Once the steam dissipates, the waffles are cooked.
