Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the apples; cook and stir until tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and pecans and continue to cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and set aside.    
Preheat the oven's broiler.    
Cut the slices of bread in half if they are very large and toast lightly. Spread the remaining butter on to one side of each piece of bread. Place two slices of brie cheese onto the unbuttered side of each piece of bread. Top with a generous scoop of the apple mixture. Place the open face sandwiches onto a baking sheet.    
Broil until the cheese has melted, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with additional cinnamon if desired.
