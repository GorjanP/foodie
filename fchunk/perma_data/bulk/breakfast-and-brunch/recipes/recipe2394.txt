Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.    
Combine potatoes and butter in a large bowl; stir to coat. Add chicken stock, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, onion, sour cream, powdered milk, chives, tarragon, sea salt, sage, and black pepper; stir well. Fold in egg until well incorporated. Pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and eggs are set, 30 to 40 minutes.
