Coat a large skillet with non-stick cooking spray. Cut each frankfurter into 5 or 6 pieces and cook in the skillet on a medium-high heat until browned. Remove and set aside.    
Spray the skillet again, return to heat and add the potatoes. Cover and cook on medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.    
When the potatoes are tender and slightly browned, add the beans and cooked frankfurters to the skillet. Season with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Heat until warmed through.
