Heat olive oil in a 9 or 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper flakes; cook stirring constantly until garlic is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.    
Stir in tomato sauce, basil and oregano. Bring to a simmer. Break eggs gently into sauce, spacing evenly around pan. Cover pan and simmer on low heat 10 minutes or until eggs are cooked as desired.    
Sprinkle eggs and sauce with Parmesan cheese and fresh oregano, if desired.
