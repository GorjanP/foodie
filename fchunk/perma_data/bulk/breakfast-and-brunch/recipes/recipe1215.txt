Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into pieces.    
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.    
Layer potatoes, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno pepper in the casserole dish. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese on top. Scatter bacon pieces over the cheese.    
Whisk eggs, milk, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and paprika together in a large bowl. Pour over layers in the casserole dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and top with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted and golden, about 10 minutes more.
