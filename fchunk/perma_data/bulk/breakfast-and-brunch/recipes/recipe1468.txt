Heat oven to 400 degrees F (375 degrees F for dark pan). Coat 24 miniature (1 3/4-inch) or 8 standard muffin cups lightly with no-stick cooking spray.    
Combine cornbread mix, mustard, milk, sour cream and egg in large bowl. Stir until smooth. Stir in cheese and bacon. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full.    
Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until light brown. Remove muffins to wire rack; cool slightly before serving.
