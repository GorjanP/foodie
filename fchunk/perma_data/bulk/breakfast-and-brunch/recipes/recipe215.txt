Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11 inch baking dish.    
In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. Stir in the bacon, hash browns, green onions, and 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar cheese on top, and continue baking for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Remove from oven, and let sit 5 minutes before serving.
