Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate.    
Bake crust in preheated oven until just beginning to brown on the edge, about 10 minutes. Let the crust cool.    
Raise oven temperature to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).    
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook asparagus pieces and sun-dried tomatoes in hot butter, stirring often, until asparagus is tender and bright green, about 10 minutes; season mixture with salt and black pepper. Transfer vegetables to the prebaked pie crust.    
Pour eggs and cream into a blender; add nutmeg. Pulse several times to blend the egg mixture; pour over vegetables in the pie crust.    
Bake in the oven until egg mixture is set and quiche is lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Let quiche stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Serve topped with chili sauce.
