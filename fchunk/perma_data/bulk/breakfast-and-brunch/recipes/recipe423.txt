Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.    
In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, beat together the sugar and oil. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla.  Blend this mixture into the flour mixture, alternately with the sour cream; stir just to combine. Fold in the zucchini and nuts; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake in preheated oven for 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
