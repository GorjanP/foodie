Heat a lightly buttered skillet over medium-high heat.    
Mix almond milk, eggs, sorghum flour, melted butter, and salt in a blender until the batter is homogenous.    
Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the hot pan and swirl quickly to form a thin layer. Cook until there is no liquid on the surface and edges start to lift up from the pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for a few seconds on the other side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter to make about 8 crepes.
