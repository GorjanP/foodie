Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.    
When the dough cycle has finished, divide into three equal portions.  Roll each piece into a rope 12 to 14 inches long.  Lay the three ropes side by side, then braid together.  Tuck the ends underneath, and place onto a greased baking sheet, cover loosely with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk.    
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Brush the braid with beaten egg white and sprinkle with pearl sugar.  Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
