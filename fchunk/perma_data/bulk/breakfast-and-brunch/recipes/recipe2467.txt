Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place 1 pie crust into an ungreased 9-inch pie plate.    
Mix prepared sausage, 5 eggs, mixed vegetables and cheese together in bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour into crust. Top with remaining pie crust and crimp edges to seal. Cut 3 slits in top crust. Brush with remaining 1 beaten egg.    
Bake for 35 to 37 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. If needed, cover pot pie with foil to prevent top crust from over browning.    
Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
