Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mix oats, buckwheat, sunflower seeds, and salt in a large bowl.    
Melt coconut oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir in honey and seeds from vanilla bean until mixed. Pour over oat mixture and toss to coat. Spread oat mixture evenly over prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until granola is lightly brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Stir almonds into granola and continue baking until golden grown, about 5 to 10 minutes more. Allow granola to cool completely, then stir in coconut and raisins. Store in an airtight container.
