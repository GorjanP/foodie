Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter and 1 tablespoon jam onto one side of each of six bread slices; top each with another bread slice to make 6 sandwiches.    
Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, raspberry-flavored liqueur, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Dip each sandwich into egg mixture, turning to coat both sides.    
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook sandwiches, working in batches, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
