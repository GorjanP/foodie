Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.    
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.    
Combine baking mix, butter and boiling water.  Divide biscuit mixture between muffin cups. Spread covering bottom and up the sides a little. Sprinkle sausage and onions.    
Stir together eggs and cream. Pour equal amounts of egg mixture into muffin cups. Cover with Swiss cheese.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, until eggs are set.
