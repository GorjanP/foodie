Heat a skillet over high heat; add SPAM(R) with Bacon, reduce heat to medium and cook and stir until SPAM(R) with Bacon starts to brown, 2 to 5 minutes.    
While SPAM(R) with Bacon is browning, crack eggs into a bowl, add water and whisk thoroughly with a fork.    
Reduce heat to low; pour eggs into skillet. Cook and stir lightly until eggs are set.    
Remove SPAM(R) with Bacon mixture from skillet.    
Turn heat up to medium and place first tortilla into skillet. Top with SPAM(R) with Bacon mixture, salsa, and Colby-Jack cheese.
