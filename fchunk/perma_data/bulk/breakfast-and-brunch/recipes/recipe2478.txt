Place strawberries, sugar, and water into blender and blend until the mixture is smooth.    
Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking pan; stir in the wine.    
Freeze, stirring once about halfway through, until mixture is slushy, 4 1/2 to 5 hours.    
Remove from freezer and stir to breakup the larger frozen clumps.
