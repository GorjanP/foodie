Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Prepare pastry for a one crust pie as directed on package.  Divide pastry into 4 equal parts.  Roll each part into a 6 inch circle on a well floured, cloth covered board with a floured, cloth covered rolling pin.  Fit pastry over backs of large muffin cups (3 x 1 1/2 inch), or 6 ounce custard cups; make pleats so pastry will fit closely.  If using individual pie pans or tart pans, cut circles 1 inch larger than inverted pans, and fit into pans.  Prick surface.  Place tarts on an ungreased cookie sheet.    
Bake until light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes, and carefully remove from cups.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place 2  bacon slices in the bottom of each pastry cup.  Sprinkle cheese over the meat, making slight well in centers.  Break 1 egg into each.  Add 1 tablespoon milk into each tart.  Sprinkle with nutmeg and pepper.  Place tarts on an ungreased cookie sheet    
Bake until eggs are soft cooked, about 15 to 20 minutes.
