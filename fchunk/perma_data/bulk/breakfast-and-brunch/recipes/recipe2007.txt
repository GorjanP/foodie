Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin pan.    
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the leek, green onion, and salt and pepper; cook until soft and tender.  Pour in the beef broth; whisk in the flour. Simmer until mixture becomes creamy and thick.    
Line each muffin cup with 1 slice of ham to form a cup. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the leek mixture into the bottom of each ham cup. Top with a heaping tablespoon of cheese. Press the cheese down lightly with a spoon. Beat eggs and cream in a large bowl. Divide egg mixture evenly between the ham cups.    
Bake cups in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 12 to 15 minutes. Allow baked eggs to rest for at least 10 minutes in muffin cups. Remove by gently pulling on the crisped ham edge and lifting up. Serve immediately or refrigerate.
