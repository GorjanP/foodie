Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set a wire rack over the foil. Use a baking sheet that has sides to catch the grease.    
In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, mustard powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Press each slice of bacon into the mixture until coated. Twist each strip a few times and place on the prepared baking rack.    
Bake until bacon is browned and crisp enough to hold its shape, about 30 minutes.
