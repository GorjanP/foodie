Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 8 muffin cups.    
In a large skillet or frying pan, cook ground chuck with onion and garlic powder until evenly brown; drain off the grease. Stir in the barbeque sauce and simmer for another 3 minutes.    
Roll out each biscuit on a floured surface so that each biscuit is 6 inches across. Put the biscuit in the muffin tin and fold up sides to  create a cup shape. Fill each biscuit fill almost to the top with the meat mixture; top with cheddar cheese.    
Bake in preheated oven until biscuits are baked, cheese is melted and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
