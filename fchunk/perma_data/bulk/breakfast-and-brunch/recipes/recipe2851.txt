Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with butter.    
Combine flour, sugar, coconut, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; stir once or twice with a wooden spoon. Add eggs, milk, water, oil, coconut extract, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Mix well until batter is blended.    
Pour batter into the greased loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
