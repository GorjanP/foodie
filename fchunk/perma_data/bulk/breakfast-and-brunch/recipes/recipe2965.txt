Beat eggs, milk, nutmeg, and cinnamon together with a fork in a bowl until somewhat smooth.    
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat.    
Dip a bread slice into egg mixture to evenly and generously coat each side and put into the hot skillet; cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with each bread slice.    
Cut each slice in half on a diagonal and arrange onto 2 plates. Arrange banana and strawberry slices on the plates around the French toast. Drizzle maple syrup over the French toast; dust with confectioners' sugar.
