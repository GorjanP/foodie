Combine bananas, sunflower seed butter, eggs, maple syrup, arrowroot flour, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and baking soda together in a bowl until batter is smooth.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
