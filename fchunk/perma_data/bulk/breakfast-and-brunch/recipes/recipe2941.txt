Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Put coconut oil into a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Place baking dish in the preheated oven to melt coconut oil, about 3 minutes.    
Whisk eggs and coconut milk together in a large bowl. Whisk in spelt flour and salt to make a smooth batter. Pour batter into the hot baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, rotating the baking dish once halfway through, about 18 minutes.
