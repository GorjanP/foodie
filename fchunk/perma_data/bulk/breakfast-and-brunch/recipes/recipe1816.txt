Whisk buttermilk, egg, maple syrup, and coconut oil together in a bowl.    
Whisk spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add blueberries and toss gently to coat.    
Stir buttermilk mixture into the spelt flour mixture until just combined.    
Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium-high heat. Drop 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles begin to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
