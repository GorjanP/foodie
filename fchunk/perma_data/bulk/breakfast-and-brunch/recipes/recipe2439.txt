Position rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler.    
Heat oil in a large broiler-safe nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and zucchini and cook, stirring frequently until soft, about 5 minutes.    
In a bowl, whisk eggs, salt and pepper together. Pour over the vegetables in the pan. Cook about 2 minutes until nearly set. While cooking lift the edges to allow uncooked egg from the middle to go underneath. Top with Fresh Mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes, place under broiler until the eggs are slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 3 minutes. Top with basil. Slice and serve.
