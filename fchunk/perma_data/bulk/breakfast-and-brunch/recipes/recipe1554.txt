Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a deep 9-inch baking dish.    
Combine eggs, milk, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.  Whisk until smooth.  Stir in tomatoes and feta cheese; pour into prepared baking dish. Scatter bread pieces on top of egg mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until eggs are fully set, 40-50 minutes.
