Pour applesauce, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, vanilla and maple extracts, hemp hearts, and chia seeds into a slow cooker. Stir until well combined; add oats and pecans and stir again.    
Cook the granola in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours, venting the lid slightly. If you smell the granola cooking, it's time to stir. Keep an eye on it or it will burn if not stirred occasionally.    
Pour the finished granola onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and allow to cool completely. Store in an airtight container and enjoy!
