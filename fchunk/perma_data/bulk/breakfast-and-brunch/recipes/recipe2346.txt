Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch deep-dish pie dish.    
Run beet, carrots, cucumber, celery, spinach, and garlic through juicer according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer pulp to a bowl and mix in onion.    
Whisk yogurt, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese, egg whites, and egg together in a separate bowl. Fold pulp mixture and chicken into egg mixture; pour into the prepared pie dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the quiche comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.
