Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; add flour, curry powder, and pepper. Cook and stir butter-flour mixture until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until curry sauce is smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix eggs into sauce and cook until eggs are heated, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Serve curried eggs over toast.
