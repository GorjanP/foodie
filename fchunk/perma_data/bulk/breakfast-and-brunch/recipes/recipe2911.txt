Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf plans with coconut oil and sprinkle with gluten-free flour.    
Beat eggs in a large bowl; stir in coconut sugar, coconut oil, applesauce, cane sugar, vanilla extract, baking soda, baking powder, Ceylon cinnamon, and Himalayan salt. Mix in gluten-free flour and chickpea flour, 1 cup at a time; stir until mixed well. Fold in zucchini, pecans, and raspberries. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.    
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.
