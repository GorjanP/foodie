Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Mix zucchini, eggs, vegetable oil, onion powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in potato flakes and baking powder; mix until batter is combined.    
Pour 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the waffle iron. Close the lid; cook until iron stops steaming and waffle is crisp, about 5 minutes.
