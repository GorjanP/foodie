In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper  sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Pour mixture into a wide, shallow dish.    
Layer 2 slices bread with equal amounts of the sliced ham and cheese; top with remaining bread slices to make sandwiches, and press down to secure filling. Dip sandwiches into egg mixture, and turn to coat both sides.    
Heat the oil in a griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Cook sandwiches 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cheese has melted. Serve hot.
