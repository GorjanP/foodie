Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Place squash, cut-side down, onto prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until flesh is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool until easily handled.    
Scrape spaghetti squash flesh into a large bowl using a fork. Whisk eggs, evaporated milk, garlic powder, salt, and oregano together in a separate bowl; pour over squash. Mix chicken, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, 1/2 of the green onions, bacon bits, and black pepper into squash mixture; pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Top mixture with remaining Parmesan cheese and green onions.    
Bake in the oven until cooked through and set, about 45 minutes.
