Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mix quinoa, steel-cut oats, almonds, cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, coconut flakes, chia seeds, flax seeds, cocoa powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.    
Combine honey, coconut oil, vanilla extract, and stevia in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted together, 30 seconds to 1 minute.    
Pour honey mixture over the quinoa mixture; mix well to combine. Spread in an even layer on the baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely before breaking into pieces, about 30 minutes.
