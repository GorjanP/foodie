Whisk coconut flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.    
Stir pumpkin puree, coconut milk, sugar, and xanthan gum together in another bowl until smooth; stir into flour mixture until batter is thick and smooth.    
Heat oil in a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
