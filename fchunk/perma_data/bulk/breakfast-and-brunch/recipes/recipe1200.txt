Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Butter the insides of 2 (10-ounce) ramekins and place on a baking sheet.    
Place bread cubes into a large bowl, set aside.    
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bacon in hot oil until browned and almost crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove excess oil from skillet and discard.    
Stir in onion and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in red pepper and cook for an additional minute.    
Stir in chicken broth and heavy cream; cook until mixture begins to simmer, about 1 to 2 minutes.    
Pour cream mixture over bread cubes and mix thoroughly until all liquid is absorbed.    
Stir in 1 egg, lemon juice, tarragon, and lemon zest.    
Mix in crabmeat, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.    
Spoon Mixture into prepared ramekins and bake in a preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes.    
Remove ramekins from oven and top each bread pudding with a poached egg. Spoon hollandaise sauce over each egg. Garnish with cayenne pepper.
