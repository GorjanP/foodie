Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, applesauce, eggs, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to almond milk mixture and stir until batter is just moistened. Stir granola and almonds into batter.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
