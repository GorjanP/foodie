Heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch glass pie plate.    
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Pat dry on paper towels and crumble the bacon. Sprinkle bacon, cheese, and onion in the pie plate.    
In a medium bowl, stir the milk, eggs, baking mix, and pepper with fork until blended. Pour into pie plate.    
Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.
