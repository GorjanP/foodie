Combine flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.    
Beat egg yolks and butter together in a bowl until smooth; add coconut milk and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is evenly combined.    
Beat egg whites in a bowl until foamy, about 2 minutes; gently fold into batter.    
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
