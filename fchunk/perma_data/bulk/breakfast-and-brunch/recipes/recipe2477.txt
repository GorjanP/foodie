Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.    
Mix whole wheat flour, brown sugar, flaxseed meal, oats, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.    
Combine eggs, butter, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter milk, and vanilla extract in another bowl. Stir in flour mixture. Add bananas; mix until batter is well-combined. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool, about 25 minutes.
