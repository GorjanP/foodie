Process the yellow squash through a zoodler (vegetable peeler that forms noodle-shape pieces) until squash zoodles form.    
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir squash zoodles, spinach, and cilantro until zoodles are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Spread mixture evenly into the bottom of the skillet.    
Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl; pour over squash mixture. Cook until egg is firm, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over egg mixture and cook until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
