Combine boiling water, oats, shortening, brown sugar, salt, and molasses.  Allow to cool.    
Stir 1/2 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon white sugar until sugar is dissolved.  Sprinkle yeast over this mixture, and proof while oats are cooling.    
Add 3 cups of warm water to the cooled oat mixture.  Stir in yeast.  Begin stirring in flour 1 cup at a time until it begins to get hard to stir.  Dredge raisins in flour, and mix with cinnamon; mix into the dough.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface, and knead in enough flour to make a soft but not sticky dough.  Cover.  Let rise for 1 to 2 hours in a warm place, or until dough doubles in size.    
Divide dough into 5 parts.  Shape loaves, and place into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.    
Bake in a preheated 375 degree F (190 degree C) oven for 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 20 minutes.  Cool on wire racks.
