Whisk milk, egg, and cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Dip panettone slice in the milk mixture; turn to ensure both sides are coated and most of the liquid has been absorbed.    
Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook panettone in the hot butter until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
