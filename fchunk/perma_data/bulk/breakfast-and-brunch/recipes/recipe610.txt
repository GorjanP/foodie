Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a shallow bowl, mix brown sugar and cinnamon. Dip bacon slices in the brown sugar mixture to coat, and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet.    
Bake 8 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until dark golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
