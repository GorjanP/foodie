Combine water, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl. Mix together and let sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Form dough into patties about 5 inches across and 1/2-inch thick.    
Coat a griddle with butter. Cook patties, one at a time, over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.
