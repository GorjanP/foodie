Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Coat a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat; cook and stir onion and zucchini until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.    
Place cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and add water; cook in microwave until cauliflower is tender, about 3 minutes. Drain water.    
Whisk egg whites, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add zucchini-onion mixture, cauliflower, and pepperjack cheese. Pour egg mixture into a 10-inch round pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until quiche is set in the middle, about 25 minutes.
