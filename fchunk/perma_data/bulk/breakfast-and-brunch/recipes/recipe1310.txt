Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch pie plate.    
Press spinach in an even, compact layer into the bottom of the prepared pie plate.    
Beat milk, ham, eggs, baking mix, onion, Cheddar cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese together in a bowl; pour over the spinach layer.    
Bake in preheated oven until quiche is set in the middle, 35 to 40 minutes.
