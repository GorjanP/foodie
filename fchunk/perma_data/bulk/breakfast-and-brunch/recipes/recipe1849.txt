Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Stir in rice, cover pan, and remove from heat.  Allow to stand until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Stir in butter and salt, if desired.    
Spray a 9 inch pie pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Spoon cooked rice into pan.  Use the back of a spoon to firmly press rice along the bottom and sides of the pan to create a crust. Use crust with quiche fillings of choice, and bake as directed for quiche.
