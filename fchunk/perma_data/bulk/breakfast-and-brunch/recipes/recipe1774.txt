Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir flour, mustard, salt, and pepper into butter until mixture is smooth and bubbly. Remove from heat and add milk. Return to heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly; boil until mixture thickens, about 1 minute.    
Stir ham and eggs into milk mixture and cook until heated through. Spoon creamed ham and eggs onto biscuits.
