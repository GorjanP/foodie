Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a round baking dish with olive oil and line with parchment paper.    
Beat eggs in a bowl until frothy; add milk, basil, rosemary, mint, thyme, salt, and pepper and mix well. Mix honey and lemon zest into Greek yogurt. Stir yogurt mixture and Scamorza cheese into eggs. Pour egg mixture into the prepared baking dish and top with Parmesan cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the center, about 15 minutes.
