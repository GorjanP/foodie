Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of one 5x9 inch loaf pan.    
In a large bowl combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, butter, egg, orange zest, milk and orange juice. Beat at low speed just until moistened. Then beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Fold in the blueberries and spread into the prepared pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick poked into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
