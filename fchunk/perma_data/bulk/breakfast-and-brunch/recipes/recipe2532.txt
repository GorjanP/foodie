Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring water to a boil. Cook eggs at a boil for 10 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water and set aside to cool.    
Peel cooled eggs and cut into large chunks.    
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry egg chunks in melted butter until golden brown, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
