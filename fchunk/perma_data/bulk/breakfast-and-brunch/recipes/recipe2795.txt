Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mix pumpkin seeds, oats, pumpkin puree, maple-flavored syrup, coconut, butter, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl until well combined. Spread mixture evenly over the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until desired crispness is reached, 30 to 45 minutes.
