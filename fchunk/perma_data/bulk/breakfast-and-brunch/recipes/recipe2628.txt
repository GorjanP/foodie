Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    
Cook breakfast sausage according to package directions; set aside.    
In a skillet, brown the hash browns in butter until crisp.    
Spread hash browns into the bottom of a greased 9-in. deep dish pie plate (about 1-3/4 in. deep)    
Sprinkle cheese into center of the pie plate.    
Arrange breakfast sausage around the edge of the pie plate at a slight angle; using cheese to help hold up the links.    
In a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, onion powder, salt and pepper; pour into pie plate.    
Arrange tomato slices on top of quiche; sprinkle with chives.    
Cover sausage at edge of quiche with foil to prevent overbrowning.    
Bake for 40-45 minutes or until eggs are set.  Let rest 5 minutes before cutting.
