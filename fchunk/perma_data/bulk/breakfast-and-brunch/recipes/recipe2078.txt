Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Set sausage mixture aside to cool.    
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Beat milk and eggs in another large bowl; stir flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is smooth. Add cooled sausage and onion to batter.    
Heat a non-stick griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Pour about 1/4 cup portions of batter onto hot skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
