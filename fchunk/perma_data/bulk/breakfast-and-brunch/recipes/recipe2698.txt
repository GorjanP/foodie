Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Arrange bagels onto a baking sheet with the cut sides up. Arrange bacon pieces atop the bagel halves. Spoon gravy lightly atop the bacon. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the gravy.    
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes.
