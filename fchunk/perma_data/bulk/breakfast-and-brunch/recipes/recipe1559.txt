Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a saucepan and slowly whisk in grits, followed by salt and black pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer the grits until tender and thickened, about 30 minutes.    
Stir 1 tablespoon unsalted butter into grits, season with more salt and black pepper if needed, and remove from heat. Cover pan and keep grits warm.    
Sprinkle shrimp with salt and black pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir shrimp, garlic, and cayenne pepper until shrimp are pink and no longer translucent inside, 3 to 4 minutes.    
Stir 2 tablespoons water into shrimp and mix in lemon juice and parsley. Sprinkle with more salt and pepper if desired.    
Portion cooked grits into serving bowls and top with shrimp and sauce; serve with lemon wedges.
