Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Lightly grease a 2-quart baking dish.    
Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in grits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the grits are thick, stirring often, about 5 minutes.    
Stir ham, Cheddar cheese, eggs, green onion, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into grits.    
Transfer grit mixture to the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 25 minutes.
