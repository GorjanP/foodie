Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.    
Place 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a medium size frying pan, heat on medium-high. Add sesame seeds and stir constantly until seeds are lightly browned.    
In a large mixing bowl, combine vegetable oil, onion, garlic, zucchini, eggs, bread crumbs, salt, basil, oregano, pepper and Cheddar cheese; stir until well combined.  Press mixture into prepared baking pan. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and sesame seeds over the zucchini mixture.    
Bake 30 minutes or until set when lightly touched in the center. Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting into 1 inch squares.
