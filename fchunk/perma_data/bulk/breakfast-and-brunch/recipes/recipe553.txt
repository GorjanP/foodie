In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, baking powder and sugar. Stir in buttermilk and bananas just until moistened.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
