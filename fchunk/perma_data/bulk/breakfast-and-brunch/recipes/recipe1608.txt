Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.    
In a large bowl, mix together wheat germ, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, cashews, almonds, coconut, rolled wheat and rolled oats.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix oil, honey and vanilla. Cook and stir just until the mixture is hot. Stir into the wheat germ mixture.    
Spread the mixture on the prepared baking sheet. Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, stirring approximately every 20 minutes, until golden brown.
