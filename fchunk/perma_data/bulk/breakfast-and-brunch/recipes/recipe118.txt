Sift together flour, baking powder, soda, salt, and spices.    
In a large bowl, beat eggs until light and fluffy.  Add sugar, and continue beating until well blended.  Stir in oil, vanilla, zucchini, nuts, chocolate chips, and orange rind.  Blend in sifted ingredients.  Turn batter into two greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes, or until bread tests done.  Remove loaves from pans, and cool.  Chill before slicing.
