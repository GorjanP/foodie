Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.    
Rinse shredded potatoes in a colander with cold water; drain and squeeze potatoes to remove liquid.    
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add potato. Season potato with salt and pepper; stir. Place a cover on the skillet and cook until potato is tender, about 3 minutes.    
Heat a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage in the skillet, breaking with a spatula into crumbles, until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir potatoes into the sausage and remove skillet from heat. Spread the sausage and potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish.    
Beat eggs and cream together in a bowl; add Gouda cheese and stir. Pour the egg mixture atop the sausage and potato mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until the egg is set, about 25 minutes.
