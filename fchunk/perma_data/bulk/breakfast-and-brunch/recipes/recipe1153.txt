Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, or line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.    
In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.    
Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the bananas.    
Mix in the self-rising flour and flax seed meal until just incorporated; fold in the walnuts.    
Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes for muffins, or 1 hour for a loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
