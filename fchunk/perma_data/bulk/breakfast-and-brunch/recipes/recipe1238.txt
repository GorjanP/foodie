Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with foil baking cups and spray with cooking spray.    
Mix spinach, egg substitute, Cheddar cheese, onion, green bell pepper, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Divide spinach mixture evenly among prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
