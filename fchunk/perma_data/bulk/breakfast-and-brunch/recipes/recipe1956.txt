Bring coconut milk to a gentle boil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in oats and honey; lower heat and simmer until milk has mostly been absorbed, about 15 minutes.    
Sprinkle coconut flakes, brown sugar, and cinnamon into oatmeal. Cook until oats are creamy and flavors are combined, about 5 minutes.
