Combine tomatoes, chile de arbol peppers, onion, garlic, chicken bouillon, and salt in a saucepan; add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes and peppers soften, 5 to 10 minutes.    
Transfer chile peppers to a blender using a slotted spoon; blend until smooth. Pour in tomato mixture; blend until smooth.    
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir corn tortillas in the hot oil until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Crack in eggs; stir until scrambled and set, about 5 minutes. Strain blended sauce over tortillas and eggs; mix well.
