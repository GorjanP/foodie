Melt the ghee in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the shallots, and cook until the shallots begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Season with the curry powder, and cook 5 minutes more. Add the tablespoon of water if needed to keep the shallots from burning.    
Meanwhile, place the cream cheese into a microwave-safe bowl, and cook in the microwave until the cream cheese is fairly soft, about 30 seconds on High. Whisk in the eggs and Dijon mustard until the cream cheese is mostly mixed in (a few lumps are fine). Stir the egg mixture into the skillet with the shallots, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the eggs have firmed. They will still be softer than normal scrambled eggs because of the cream cheese.  Season to taste with salt and pepper just as the eggs are ready to come out of the pan.
