Combine flour, sugar, and anise seed together in a very large bowl; create a well in the center.    
Mix warm water and yeast together in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.    
Beat warm milk, eggs, and butter together in a bowl; stir into yeast mixture. Add milk mixture to the well in the flour mixture. Knead flour-milk mixture using your hands until dough and your hands are no longer sticky. Cover dough with a clean cotton cloth and let rise, 8 hours to overnight.    
Grease and flour 6 loaf pans.    
Punch dough down and divide into 6 portions. Mold each portion into a round shape and place each in a prepared pan. Cover pans and let rise for 1 hour more.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is cooked through, 45 to 50 minutes.
