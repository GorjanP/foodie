Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, rum extract, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a bowl. Dip each bread slice into the egg mixture, turning to coat both sides.    
Melt butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add bread slices in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
