Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, ground cumin, and red pepper flakes; stir until mixed. Add potatoes; cook and stir until softened, about 12 minutes.    
Stir luncheon meat into the potato mixture; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce. Remove from heat.    
Heat tortillas in a toaster oven or conventional oven on warm setting until warmed, about 2 minutes.    
Place large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into warmed tortillas; season with salt and pepper.
