Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Combine baking mix, tarragon, dry mustard, and black pepper in a bowl.    
Whisk eggs and milk together in a separate bowl; pour the egg mixture into the baking mix and seasonings, and whisk until smooth.    
Pour half the batter into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.    
Arrange half the asparagus spears over the batter.    
Top asparagus spears with ham and onion; sprinkle on 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.    
Pour the remaining batter over the Parmesan cheese, and arrange the remaining asparagus spears on top. Sprinkle casserole with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
