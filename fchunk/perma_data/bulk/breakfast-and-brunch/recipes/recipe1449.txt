Place rolled oats into a food processor and grind to flour. Place sweet potato into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until very soft, about 20 minutes. Drain.    
Blend sweet potato, eggs, banana, and milk in a blender until smooth; pour batter into a large bowl. Stir protein powder and ground oats into batter.    
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat. Drop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, into the skillet, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
