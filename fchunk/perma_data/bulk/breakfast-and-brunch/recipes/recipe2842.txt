Mix rolled oats, kefir, sucanat, butter, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Refrigerate until oats soften, 8 hours to overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x17-inch baking pan.    
Stir beaten eggs into the oatmeal mixture until fully blended. Add raisins, baking powder, and salt.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan, 25 to 30 minutes.
