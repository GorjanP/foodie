Whisk eggs, Parmesan cheese, milk, and black pepper in a shallow bowl until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.    
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.    
Dip both sides of each slice of bread in the egg mixture and place in the skillet. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a warmed plate and dot with butter to serve.
