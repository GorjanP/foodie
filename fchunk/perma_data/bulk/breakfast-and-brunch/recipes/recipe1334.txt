Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease or spray with non-stick cooking spray a 9-inch square baking dish or similar sized baking dish.    
Cut each biscuit into 4 equal pieces;  set aside. Sprinkle 1 cup of the ham, 1 cup of the apples and all the raisins over the bottom of the prepared pan, spreading evenly.  Arrange biscuit pieces, pointed ends up, over the mixture.  Sprinkle evenly with remaining ham and apples.    
In a small mixing bowl combine brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice, maple syrup and egg, blending thoroughly. Stir in nuts, then spoon evenly over biscuit pieces and ham/apple mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until nicely browned. Cool for 5 minutes, then drizzle Spice Spiked Glaze over warm coffeecake.    
To Make Spice Spiked Glaze:  In a small bowl whisk together the confectioners' sugar, bourbon, 1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice, and cayenne pepper until a drizzling consistency is reached (more bourbon or milk may be added if necessary to achieve desired consistency).
