Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove from the pan, and set on paper towels to drain. Crack the eggs into the pan with the bacon grease so that they are about 1 inch apart. Season with salt and pepper. When the eggs look firm, flip them over, and cook on the other side to your desired doneness. Transfer to a plate and serve with bacon.
