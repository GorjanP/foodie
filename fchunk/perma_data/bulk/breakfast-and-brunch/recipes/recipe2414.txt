Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Unroll crescent dough and separate individual rolls at perforations. Place 1 piece of ham and 1 tablespoon of Gruyere cheese in the center of each triangle. Fold over the 2 longer sides of the triangle, overlapping them to seal ham and cheese.    
Arrange crescents 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool completely on a cooling rack.    
Wrap crescents individually with wax paper and place into a large resealable bag. Place in the freezer.
