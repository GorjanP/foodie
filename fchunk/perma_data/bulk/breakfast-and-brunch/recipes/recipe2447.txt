Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Lightly beat eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add corned beef hash and stir to break up chunks. Mix in tomato, green pepper, mushrooms, green onion, salt, and pepper. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish.    
Bake in preheated oven until veggies have softened and eggs are set, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Let sit several minutes before cutting into squares and serving.
