Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Generously grease the bottom of a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.    
Measure oil, bananas, vanilla, eggs, baking mix, sugar, and nuts into a large bowl.  Beat vigorously with a spoon for about 30 seconds.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 to 65 minutes.  Cool for 5 minutes in the pan.  Loosen sides of loaf from the pan.  Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
