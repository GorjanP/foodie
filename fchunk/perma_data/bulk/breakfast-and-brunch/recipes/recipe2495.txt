Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.    
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potato and onion; cook and stir until potatoes are golden brown and soft, about 10 minutes.    
Place chorizo in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes.    
Whisk eggs with milk in a large bowl. Add red bell pepper, cooked potato and onion, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese to the egg mixture; pour into the casserole dish. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until firm and cheese is melted and starting to brown, about 30 minutes. Cool before serving, about 10 minutes.
