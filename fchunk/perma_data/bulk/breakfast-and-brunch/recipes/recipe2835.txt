Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 3-quart baking dish.    
Combine hash browns, Cheddar cheese, onion, bacon, green bell pepper, and parsley in a bowl. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.    
Mix eggs and cottage cheese together in a blender until smooth. Pour evenly over the potato mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
