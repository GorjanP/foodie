Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.    
In a large mixing bowl, mix together oats, flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Stir in eggs and buttermilk. Fold in blueberries.    
Pour or spoon the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
