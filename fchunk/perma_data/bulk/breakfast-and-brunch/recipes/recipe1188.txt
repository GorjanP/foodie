Bring quinoa, water, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla extract to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and has absorbed the water, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.    
Mix cherries, cashews, and honey into the quinoa mixture; top with blackberries and creme fraiche.
