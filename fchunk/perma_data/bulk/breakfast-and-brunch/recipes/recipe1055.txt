Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus until slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie pastry into a 10-inch deep-dish pie pan.    
Combine asparagus, eggs, milk, half-and-half, French-fried onions, Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese, and green onion in a bowl. Pour into prepared pie pastry.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center of quiche is set and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow to stand for 10 minutes before serving.
