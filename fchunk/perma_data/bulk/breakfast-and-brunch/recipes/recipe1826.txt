Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.    
Bring milk, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat. Combine oats, apples, dried cranberries, and walnuts in a bowl; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Pour milk mixture over oat mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
