Prepare rice according to package directions. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
While rice cooks, saute bacon pieces in a 10-inch oven proof skillet over medium heat until starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat, then add the scallion whites and edamame (or if desired, use 1 cup frozen green peas) to the bacon in the pan and saute one minute.    
Add the cooked rice, and saute one minute. Whisk together the eggs, 1/2 cup sour cream, and the salt, and add to the pan, swirling gently to distribute the egg mixture evenly throughout the other ingredients. Cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes, until edges look set then place the pan in the preheated oven until set in the center, about 10 minutes further.    
Mix together the scallion greens with the remaining 1/2 cup sour cream, and serve frittata in wedges topped with a dollop of the scallion cream.
