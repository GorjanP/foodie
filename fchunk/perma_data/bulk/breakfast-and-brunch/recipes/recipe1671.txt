Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble. Reserve bacon drippings in skillet.    
Heat a stovetop grill over medium heat and cook shrimp until pink and no longer translucent in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Place cooked shrimp, green onion, garlic, and crumbled bacon in the bacon drippings left in the skillet. Turn heat to low and keep shrimp mixture warm.    
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan, melt butter in the water, stir in grits, and cook covered for 5 minutes. Turn heat to low. Stir shrimp mixture with bacon drippings into the grits; stir in Cheddar cheese until thoroughly melted and combined. Serve topped with barbeque sauce.
