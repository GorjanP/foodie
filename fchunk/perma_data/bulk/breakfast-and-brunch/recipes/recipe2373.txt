Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line muffin cups with paper liners, adding extra grease to the bottoms of the cups.    
Cook chicken broth and quinoa together in a rice cooker or bring to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Mix quinoa, spinach, Colby-Jack cheese, eggs, bacon bits, onion powder, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and white pepper together in a bowl; spoon into the prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
