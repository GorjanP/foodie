In a large bowl, beat together eggs and milk. Stir in cinnamon and nutmeg.    
Heat a non-stick skillet to medium heat. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture, place in the skillet and cook until lightly brown on both sides.    
Remove bread from skillet. Layer four slices of bread with a slice of Swiss cheese, ham, Swiss cheese, turkey and Swiss cheese again. Cover with remaining four bread slices. Return sandwiches to skillet; grill until cheese has melted and bread has browned. Serve hot.
