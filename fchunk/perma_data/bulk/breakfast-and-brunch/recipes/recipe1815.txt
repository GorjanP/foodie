Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Place bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp and evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.    
Mix the bacon, ham, Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese, and onion in the baking dish. In a bowl, mix the eggs, baking mix, salt, and pepper. Pour over the ingredients in the baking dish.    
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the center of the casserole comes out clean.
