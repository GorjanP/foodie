Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease three 8x4 inch loaf pans.    
In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together bananas, butter, brown sugar and eggs. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture, just until combined. Fold in nuts. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread rest in pans for 10 minutes, ten remove loaves from pans and allow to cool on a wire rack.
