Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ham and red bell pepper; cook and stir until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs; cook, stirring gently, until scrambled and set, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.    
Wipe out skillet and place 1 flour tortilla on the bottom. Place 3 slices of mozzarella cheese on top. Top with egg mixture and remaining 3 slices mozzarella cheese. Cover with second tortilla. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. Flip and continue cooking until second side is golden, about 1 minute more.
