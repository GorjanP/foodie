In a small bowl, beat eggs and pepper together. In another small bowl, combine crumbled cheese with milk.    
Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in eggs, and tilt pan until bottom is evenly covered. When edges appear cooked, place feta mixture in a line in the center of eggs. Using a spatula, fold eggs over top and bottom of cheese, then fold sides over.
