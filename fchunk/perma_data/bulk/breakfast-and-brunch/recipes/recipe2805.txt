Melt butter in a non-stick skillet over high heat. Cook and stir garlic until quite crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add zucchini and chanterelle mushrooms. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes.    
Increase heat to medium-high and spread zucchini and mushrooms over the bottom of the skillet. Pour in eggs. Pick up skillet and tilt to spread egg evenly. Working quickly, sprinkle in cheese and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium. Watch for the top of the omelet to begin bubbling and give the pan a wiggle to loosen the base. When cheese has melted on top and egg has the desired consistency, fold omelet over and serve.
