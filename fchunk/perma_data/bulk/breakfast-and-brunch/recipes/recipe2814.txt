Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Melt butter in a medium iron skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.    
Whisk eggs, cream, and nutmeg in a bowl. Pour over zucchini mixture and sprinkle with Gouda cheese.    
Place iron skillet in the preheated oven and bake until golden and set, 15 to 20 minutes.
