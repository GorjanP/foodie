Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread potato nuggets on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Turn potato nuggets and bake until crispy, 8 minutes more.    
While potatoes bake, combine eggs, salsa, and milk in a bowl and whisk to combine.    
Heat a skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Add egg mixture. Scramble until partially set, about 2 minutes. Add green onion and bell pepper. Cook until eggs are set, about 5 minutes more. Transfer eggs to a plate.    
Place cooked potato nuggets in a large bowl and top with scrambled eggs and grated Cheddar cheese. Add salt and pepper.
