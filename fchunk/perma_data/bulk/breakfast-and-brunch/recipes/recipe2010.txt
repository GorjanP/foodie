Heat ghee in a skillet over medium heat.  Fry the onions, coriander, cumin, and cayenne pepper until the onions are soft.  Stir in the curry paste and set aside.    
In a separate skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Pour in the eggs; cook and stir until eggs are set.  Mix in the onion mixture and serve garnished with fresh cilantro.
