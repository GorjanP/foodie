Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch pie plate.    
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Whisk in the sour cream; mix until smooth. Mix in the spinach, Cheddar cheese, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, onion, tomato, green chiles, garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper.    
Pour the egg mixture into the prepared pie plate. Set pie plate on a baking sheet. Bake quiche until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
