Combine flour, oatmeal and baking powder in medium bowl. Whisk soymilk, eggs, brown sugar and soybean oil in large bowl until blended. Add flour mixture to soymilk mixture; stir just until blended. Stir in 2 cups berries.    
Heat large skillet over medium heat; brush lightly with soybean oil. Pour 1/4 cup batter into hot skillet; cook until bubbles begin to burst. Turn and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with remaining berries and maple syrup, if desired.
