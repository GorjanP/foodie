Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Stir egg, Tex-Mex cheese, green onions, jalapenos, and green chiles together in a bowl; stir in mashed potatoes. Form potato mixture into 8 patties; place on prepared baking sheet.    
Stir bread crumbs, cumin, and chili powder together in a small bowl. Dot each patty with 1 1/2 tablespoons salsa; sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons bread crumb mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and topping is lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
