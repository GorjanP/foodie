Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, ham, potatoes, tomatoes, green onions, and garlic in the hot oil until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a plate.    
Pour eggs into the same skillet and season with salt and pepper. Tilt skillet until eggs cover the entire bottom; cook over low heat until eggs are set in the middle, about 5 minutes. Spoon about 1/4 cup vegetable mixture onto 1 side of the omelet; sprinkle half the Cheddar cheese over vegetable mixture. Fold the other half of omelet over the filling. Top omelet with remaining Cheddar cheese.
