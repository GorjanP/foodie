Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease an 11x7-inch glass baking dish.    
Combine almond flour, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; stir well. Mix in olive oil using a fork until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Knead dough into a ball. Press down dough into the prepared baking dish to form the crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.  Let cool for 5 minutes. Brush bottom with Dijon mustard.    
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 3 minutes.    
Whisk eggs and heavy cream together in a bowl. Season with garlic, salt, ground black pepper, and ground nutmeg.    
Layer bacon pieces over the bottom of the almond-flour pastry; top with shredded Gouda cheese. Pour in egg mixture and place cherry tomatoes on top. Sprinkle with oregano.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 30 minutes.
