Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Cook and stir bacon in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat until evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain all but 1 teaspoon bacon grease from the skillet.    
Stir potato slices, water, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into bacon; cover the skillet with a lid and cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.    
Mix Swiss chard into potato mixture; cook and stir until chard is slightly wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Pour eggs over potato-chard mixture, stir gently, and remove skillet from heat. Top egg mixture with Parmesan cheese.    
Broil in the preheated oven until eggs are set and frittata is golden brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes.
