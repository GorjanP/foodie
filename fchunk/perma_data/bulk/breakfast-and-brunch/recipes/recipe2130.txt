Preheat and grease a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Combine spelt flour, flax seed meal, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir coconut milk, coconut oil, eggs, vinegar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add coconut milk mixture to flour mixture; stir to combine. Let batter thicken for 1 to 2 minutes.
