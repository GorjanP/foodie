Arrange dinner rolls in a tube pan. Scatter margarine pieces evenly over rolls.    
Mix pudding mix, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; pour over rolls. Place a towel over tube pan and all dough to rise overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour milk over risen dough, allowing milk to seep through any gaps.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 23 minutes. Allow bread to rest for 5 minutes. Invert pan onto a baking sheet or large plate to serve.
