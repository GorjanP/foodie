Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Place 8 ounces of cubed Cheddar cheese, onion, eggs, and evaporated milk into a blender. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, and sage, then blend until smooth. Spread salmon over the pie crust. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese then pour the egg mixture on top. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
