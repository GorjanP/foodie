Use a canning kettle, and invert the wire rack.  Fill with water to just below the wire rack.  Bring to a boil on top of the stove.    
In a large bowl, mix together molasses, oil, milk, sugar, salt, and baking soda.  Stir in white and graham flour.  Divide batter into two 1 pound coffee cans.  Place a double thickness of aluminum foil over top, and secure with rubber bands.    
Keep water at a slow boil, and steam for one hour.
