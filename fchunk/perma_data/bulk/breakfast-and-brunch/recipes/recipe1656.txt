Whisk water, milk, brown sugar, honey, and 1/4 cup vegetable oil together in a bowl. Add whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, and salt; stir until dough holds together. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth.    
Pour 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into a bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to evenly coat with oil. Allow dough to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Punch dough and knead 4 to 5 times. Divide dough in half and form each half into a loaf. Place loaves into 9x5-inch loaf pans. Allow to rise until dough is about 1 inch above the pan, about 30 minutes.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing.
