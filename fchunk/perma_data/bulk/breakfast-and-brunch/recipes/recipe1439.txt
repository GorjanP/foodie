Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Combine flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and nutmeg in a bowl; set aside.    
Beat the sugar, canola oil, whole eggs, egg white, pumpkin beer, and pumpkin puree together in a large bowl until smooth. Combine chia seeds and water in a small bowl, then whisk in the chia seed mixture into the pumpkin mixture until smooth and well-blended. Gradually stir in the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture. Mix until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan, and layer the chopped walnuts on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
