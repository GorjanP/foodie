Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast and salt in a large bowl.  Heat water and oil until very warm (120 degrees  to 130 degrees F).  Add to flour mixture and beat for 2 minutes.  Add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.)    
Roll dough to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan. OR, pat dough with floured hands, pressing gently to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet.  Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough; prick surface with fork.    
Bake crust in preheated 450 degrees F oven on lowest oven rack for 8 minutes.  Reduce oven to 375 degrees F.  Remove pizza from oven.    
Top pizza crust with sausage, hash browns and onions.  Beat eggs, ground mustard, pepper and salt together in a bowl.  Pour over toppings.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake for 16 to 20 minutes until eggs are set and crust is browned.
