Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.    
Combine oats, oat flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Add eggs, almond milk, brown sugar, and vanilla extract and mix well. Fold almonds, chocolate chips, and coconut into oats mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle, about 40 minutes. Cool before cutting into squares.
