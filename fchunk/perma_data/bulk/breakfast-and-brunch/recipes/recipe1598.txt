Whisk milk, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a shallow bowl.    
Press each slice of bread lightly into the milk mixture to coat both sides, removing it before it gets soaked.    
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook coated slices in batches until golden brown and somewhat firm, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
