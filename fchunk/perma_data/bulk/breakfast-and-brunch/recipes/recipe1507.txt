Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add shallot, and cook until lightly browned. Remove from the pan, and set aside. Fry the ham slices in the same skillet just until browned on each side. As you turn the ham to brown on the second side, place the spinach leaves on top to steam a little. Remove from the skillet and place onto a plate or onto toasted English muffins, keeping the spinach on top.    
Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet. Crack the eggs in, and fry on each side to your desired degree of doneness. Place the eggs on top of the ham stacks.    
Return the shallots to the skillet, and season with curry powder. Gradually stir in pineapple juice, scraping the bottom of the pan to mix in all of the browned bits. Increase the heat to medium-high, and boil until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over the egg stacks and serve immediately.
