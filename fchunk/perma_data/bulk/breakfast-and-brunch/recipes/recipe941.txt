Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the ground beef, stirring constantly to break it up into fine pieces. When the beef is no longer pink, add the onion, and continue cooking until the onion has softened, and the beef has browned, about 5 more minutes.    
Drain excess grease from the beef, then season with pepper flakes, parsley, oregano, and garlic powder. Stir in beef broth, mushroom soup, corn, and rice. Cook for a few minutes to warm, then pour into a casserole dish.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, then sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, and continue baking for 5 minutes or until cheese melts.
