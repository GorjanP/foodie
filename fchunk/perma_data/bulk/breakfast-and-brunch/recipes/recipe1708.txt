Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.    
Whisk eggs, oil, and brown sugar together in a bowl until brown sugar is dissolved. Combine oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture just until moistened. Spoon oat mixture into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
