In a medium sized bowl mix together the flour, salt, and baking powder.    
In a separate, larger bowl mix together the maple syrup, apple sauce, non-dairy milk, and vanilla.    
Once the wet ingredients are well incorporated, add the dry ingredients and mix well until combined.    
Cook according to your waffle iron's directions. We cooked ours on medium heat for about 5 minutes.
