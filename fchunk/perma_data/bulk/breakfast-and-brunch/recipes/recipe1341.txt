Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking pan with 2 teaspoons coconut oil.    
Combine almond flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Mix well.    
Break bananas into pieces and place in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until soft, about 30 seconds. Mash until creamy. Add eggs and 1/4 cup coconut oil; mix well. Combine with the almond flour mixture. Drop batter onto the prepared baking pan in biscuit shapes.    
Bake in the preheated oven until peaks are lightly browned, about 17 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
