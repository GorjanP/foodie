Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.    
Mix oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat in milk, butter, maple syrup, eggs, and vanilla extract; fold in cranberries. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.
