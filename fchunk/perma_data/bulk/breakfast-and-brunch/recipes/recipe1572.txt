In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg with the apple juice and melted butter. Add the remaining ingredients and stir.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. This batter must be used right away and can not sit and wait.
