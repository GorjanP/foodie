In the order suggested by the manufacturer, place milk, egg, egg yolk, bread flour, salt, butter, sugar and bread machine yeast in bread machine. Select Dough cycle, and press Start.    
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.    
On a lightly floured surface, punch down dough, and divide into 36 pieces. Roll pieces into balls. Arrange balls in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Allow balls to rise 15 to 20 minutes.    
Flatten balls, and make a depression in the center of each. Fill each with 1 piece of sausage, about 1 tablespoon hash browns, and 1 quarter slice of cheese.    
Bake 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
