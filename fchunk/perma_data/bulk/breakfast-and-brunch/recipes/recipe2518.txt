Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Heat water in a kettle or pot until it begins to steam; remove from heat. Pour 1 cup steaming water into the bottom of a casserole dish.    
Spoon 1/4 cup marinara sauce into each ramekin. Crack 1 egg over marinara in each ramekin. Arrange ramekins in the water in the casserole dish. Fill casserole dish with enough water to reach the midpoint of each ramekin.    
Bake in the preheated oven until yolks are firm, about 25 minutes.
