Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8 inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place zucchini, green onions, onion, tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach in the skillet. Sprinkle with lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook until tender. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Pour egg substitute over the vegetables in the dish. Top with cheese.    
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until egg substitute is set and cheese is melted. Cut with a spatula and enjoy!
