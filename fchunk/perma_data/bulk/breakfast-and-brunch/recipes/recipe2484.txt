Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press tortilla into a tortilla shell mold or oven-proof bowl.    
Whisk eggs, milk, and butter together in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in Mexican cheese blend.    
Bake tortilla in the preheated oven until crispy and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly before transferring from mold to serving dish, about 2 minutes.    
Cook egg mixture in the microwave until set, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove egg mixture from the microwave and stir gently with a fork. Cook in the microwave until fully set, about 30 seconds more.    
Place cooked eggs in tortilla bowl; top with avocado, salsa, paprika, and salt.
