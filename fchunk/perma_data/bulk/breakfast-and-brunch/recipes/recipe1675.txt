Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 5x9-inch loaf pan.    
Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until light and fluffy. Stir in peach puree. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and almond extract; stir until blended. Fold in pecans. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool bread in the loaf pan for 10 minutes before removing and cooling completely on a wire rack.
