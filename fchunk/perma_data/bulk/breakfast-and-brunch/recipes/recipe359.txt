Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a very large bowl, mix together the sugar, peanut butter, butter, water, vanilla and eggs until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter. Mix in the oats and raisins, then carefully stir in the cereal. Drop 1/2 cupfuls of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing cookies about 4 inches apart. Flatten cookies to 1 inch thick.    
Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned at the edges. Let stand on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store at room temperature. I like to put each cookie into a sandwich bag which makes them easy to grab on the way out the door.
