Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat eggs in a large bowl, making sure that they are mixed very well and have a 'frothy' top. Add the milk, salt and pepper. Mix well. Stir in ham, then add cheese pieces and stir well. Pour mixture into a well greased 4 quart casserole dish and bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until top is lightly browned.
