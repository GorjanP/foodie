Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with non-stick aluminum foil.    
Combine potatoes, mushrooms, onion, red bell pepper, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread potato mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven, stir potato mixture, and continue roasting until potatoes are crisp, about 20 minutes more.    
Place prosciutto in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until slightly crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer prosciutto to a cutting board and chop.    
Top potato mixture with prosciutto, basil, parsley, and Parmesan cheese.
