Season both sides of skirt steak with carne asada seasoning. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook steak until each side is seared, 6 to 8 minutes per side or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer to a plate and let rest 10 minutes before slicing into thin slices and then into small chunks. Keep warm.    
Bake steak fries according to package directions.    
Combine tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and red pepper flakes in a mixing bowl.    
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs into skillet and cook to desired doneness.    
Divide fries among 4 serving places. Top with carne asada, some of the tomato-onion mixture, shredded cheese, egg, and guacamole.
