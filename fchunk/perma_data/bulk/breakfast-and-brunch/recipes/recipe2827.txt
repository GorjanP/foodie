Whisk rice flour, eggs, almond milk, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl until well mixed.    
Combine water and 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a separate bowl until well blended. Whisk into the flour mixture. Pour batter through a sieve into a clean bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.    
Heat remaining coconut oil in a griddle over medium heat. Ladle a portion of the batter into the pan and spread out. Cook until set, about 30 seconds per side. Repeat with the remaining batter.
