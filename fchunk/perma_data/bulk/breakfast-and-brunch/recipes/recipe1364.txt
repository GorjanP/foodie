Combine sour cream, lemon juice and mustard in a bowl.  Add ham, cheese, almonds, grapes and onions.  Toss lightly to coat.    
Divide ham mixture evenly between pita pockets.  You may eat these as is or heat them briefly.  If you choose to heat them, do two halves at a time in the microwave for 1 minute.
