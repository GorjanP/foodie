Place all ingredients except raisins in your bread machine's baking pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Use the basic or white cycle. You may need to add an extra tablespoon of water during kneading    
If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the raisins at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.
