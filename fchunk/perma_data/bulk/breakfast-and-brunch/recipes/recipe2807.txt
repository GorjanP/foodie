Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add coconut milk, eggs, and oil; stir to combine. Stir in pineapple and banana until just combined; do not overmix.    
Melt brown sugar and butter together in a saucepan over medium heat. Add pineapple tidbits and 1 tablespoon reserved pineapple juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Preheat a griddle to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Pour 1/4-cup scoops of batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles form, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until set, about 5 minutes more.    
Serve pancakes with the pineapple topping.
