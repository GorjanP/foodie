Place 3 to 4 slices of banana in the bottom of a jar. Layer 1 1/2 teaspoon of almond butter, 1/2 teaspoon chia seeds, and 1/2 cup oats on top. Repeat layering remaining almond butter, chia seeds, and oats, leaving a 1-inch gap at the top.    
Mix almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Pour over oats, leaving a 1/2-inch gap at the top to allow oats to expands as they soak. Push a knife or fork vertically through the jar to make sure milk mixture soaks all the way through.    
Cover jar tightly and refrigerate until oats are moist, 4 hours to overnight.
