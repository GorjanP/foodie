Cook the chicken strips according to package directions. Dice the cooked chicken strips and place them in a bowl and toss with the hot pepper sauce.    
Stir together the mashed potatoes, eggs, and ranch dressing mix in a large bowl.    
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. In batches, drop 1/2 cup of the potato mixture into the skillet. Press to flatten. Sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of the coated chicken strips on the flattened pancake. Cook for about 4 minutes on each side, until the pancakes are golden brown. Garnish with shredded cheese and serve.
