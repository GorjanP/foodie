Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until soft, about 7 minutes; transfer to large bowl.    
Blend eggs, milk, Jarlsberg cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a food processor or blender; pour into bowl with the onion. Add chard, thyme, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper; mix. Pour egg mixture into prepared pie crust.    
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
