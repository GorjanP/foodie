Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place pie crust in a 9-inch glass pie plate.    
Cook ham in a skillet over medium heat until it no longer looks moist, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.    
Combine Cheddar cheese, milk, eggs, bell pepper, onion, garlic, black pepper, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Stir in ham. Pour into the prepared pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, top is starting to color, and filling is set, about 1 hour.
