Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine oats, almonds, coconut, sesame seeds, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.    
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla extract. Fold egg whites into the oat mixture. Spread on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until granola is crispy, about 1 hour.
