Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar; set aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl with the milk, vegetable oil, and food color. Stir the flour into the egg mixture until only slight lumps remain.    
Pour batter into waffle iron in batches, and cook until crisp and golden brown. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar to serve.
