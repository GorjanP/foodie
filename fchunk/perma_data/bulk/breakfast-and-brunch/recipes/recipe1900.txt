Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cover and steam until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer potatoes the prepared baking dish. Beat eggs with sour cream in a large bowl and pour over potatoes.    
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.    
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon and spread over potatoes and eggs.    
Heat a clean nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir bell peppers and onion in hot skillet until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spread vegetables over egg mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are softly set, about 10 minutes. Spread sausage over eggs and top with Cheddar cheese. Continue to bake until eggs are fully set and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes more.
