Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Grind uncooked rice in a blender until grains are broken; add to butter, cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.    
Stir coconut milk, water, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl to dissolve sugar; gradually add to rice, stirring constantly.    
Reduce heat to low, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
