Fry the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned and crisp. Remove from the pan, and add the potatoes and onions to the bacon drippings. Season with garlic pepper. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned. Crumble bacon over the top before serving.
