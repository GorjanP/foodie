Place tomatillos in a saucepan with water to cover; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until color begins to lighten and fruit is soft to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes.    
Transfer tomatillos to a food processor or blender. Add jalapenos, 1/3 cup cilantro, garlic, salt, and pepper; blend until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours for best flavor.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken and onion until onions begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add olives; cook for 5 minutes. Add cilantro; cook and stir until wilted, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat.    
Line the bottom of a 8-inch square casserole dish with 2 to 3 layers of tortilla chips, breaking chips slightly. Add half of the sauce; toss with chips. Top with chicken mixture and the remaining sauce. Sprinkle cotija cheese on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tortilla chips are softened, 15 to 25 minutes.
