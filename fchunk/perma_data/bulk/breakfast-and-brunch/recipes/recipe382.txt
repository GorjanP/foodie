Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
In a large bowl, combine oats, peanuts, and wheat germ.    
In a separate bowl, combine honey, brown sugar, vegetable oil, water, salt, and vanilla. Stir well; then pour into the oat mixture, and stir. Spread out on a cookie sheet.    
Bake for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool before serving.
