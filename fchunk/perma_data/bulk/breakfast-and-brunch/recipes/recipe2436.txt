Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Make a V-shaped cut in the baguette, leaving ends intact. Lift out V-shaped wedge. Hollow out baguette gently to make a long, skinny bread bowl, being careful not to cut through the bottom or sides. Place baguette on the prepared baking sheet.    
Whisk eggs in a bowl. Add milk; whisk until well blended. Stir in fontina cheese, spinach, bacon, sun-dried tomatoes, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Pour mixture slowly into the prepared baguette, spreading evenly with a spoon.    
Bake in the preheated oven until egg mixture is completely set and cheese is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; cut into 1 1/2-inch slices.
