Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 4 baking sheets.    
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended. Add second egg with vanilla extract; continue beating. Continue beating while adding vegetable oil, honey, oats, whole wheat flour, ground flax seed, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, flax seeds, baking soda, and ground cinnamon, respectively. Fold raisins into the dough.    
Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to create monster cookie size and drop onto prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just browning, about 20 minutes.
