Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
To make the gravy:  Crumble sausage in skillet and cook over medium-low heat.  Add onion and cook until tender; drain. Stir in flour, a little at a time, for about 6 minutes or until bubbly and golden.   Stir in milk, nutmeg, poultry seasoning, salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and cook until thick.    
To make biscuits:  Dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.  Stir in buttermilk and set aside.  In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt.  Cut in shortening with pastry blender until looks like coarse meal.  Stir in yeast-buttermilk mix and mix well.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 3 to 4 times.  Roll out flat to 1/2 inch and cut with 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter.  Place on lightly greased baking sheet and cover.  Let rise in warm place 1 1/2 hrs.    
Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden.  Remove from oven and brush tops with melted butter.
