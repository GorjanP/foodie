Roll out pizza dough into a 12-inch circle and press into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a well seasoned 10-inch cast iron skillet. Fold the edges of the dough under and crimp like a pie.    
Mix ricotta cheese and garlic powder together in a bowl; spread over the bottom of the crust. Scatter bacon, onion, mozzarella cheese, and black pepper on top.    
Place cast iron skillet over high heat until mozzarella cheese starts to melt, about 3 minutes.    
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; bake pizza until crust is lightly browned, about 18 minutes.
