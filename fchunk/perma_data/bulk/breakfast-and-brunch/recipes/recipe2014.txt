Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until well blended. When the pan is hot, pour the eggs in. Cook, stirring frequently, until the eggs are scrambled. Nice scrambled eggs should have a soft texture, not hard and leathery.    
Remove the eggs from the heat, and stir in the mayonnaise and chili sauce. Serve immediately.
