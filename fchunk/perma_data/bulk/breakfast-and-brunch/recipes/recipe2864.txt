Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with coconut oil.    
Combine spinach and eggs in a food processor; pulse until blended. Add chickpeas; pulse until blended. Add nutritional yeast, Parmesan cheese, paprika, salt, and pepper; pulse until evenly incorporated.    
Pour spinach mixture into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup 2/3 full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
