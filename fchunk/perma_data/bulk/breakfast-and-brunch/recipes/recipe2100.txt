Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix potatoes, sour cream, Cheddar cheese, cream of celery soup, onion, 1/4 cup butter, white pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; spread into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle corn flakes and cheese-flavored crackers over potato mixture and drizzle remaining butter over the top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cooked through, about 1 hour.
