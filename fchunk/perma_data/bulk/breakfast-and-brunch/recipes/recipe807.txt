Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat.    
Whisk together the muffin mix, flour, baking powder, egg, milk, and cooking oil until smooth.    
Pour 1/4 cup of batter into skillet. Cook pancake until bubbles form on top and bottom is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; flip and cook until bottom side reaches same golden-brown color of top of pancake. Repeat until batter is completely used.
