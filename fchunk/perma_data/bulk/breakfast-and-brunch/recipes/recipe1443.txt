Whisk flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves together in a large bowl. Beat milk, pumpkin, eggs, 2 tablespoon vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and stir until batter is well-combined.    
Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
