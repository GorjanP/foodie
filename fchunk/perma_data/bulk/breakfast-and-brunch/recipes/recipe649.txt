Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute green onion and red bell pepper until soft. Stir in crabmeat, and season with salt and pepper. Add wine, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat, and allow to cool.    
In a large bowl, beat eggs until light. Whisk in half-and-half, and crab mixture. Pour into pie crust, and sprinkle with Swiss cheese.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.
