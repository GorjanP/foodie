Place the tortillas into a microwave oven, and heat on high until warmed and pliable, 10 to 15 seconds.    
Spread each tortilla with cottage cheese and pineapple, sprinkle with granola cereal and brown sugar, and top with a sliced banana.    
Fold the top and bottom of each tortilla down, enclosing the filling, and roll the wrap tightly into a compact cylinder. Slice each wrap in half across the middle to serve.
