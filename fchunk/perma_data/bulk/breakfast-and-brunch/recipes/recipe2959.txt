Stir milk and lemon juice together in a bowl; let sit until milk begins to slightly sour, about 10 minutes. Stir oats into milk mixture; cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.    
Mix eggs, flour, baking powder, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cloves, and salt into oat mixture until batter is evenly combined.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
