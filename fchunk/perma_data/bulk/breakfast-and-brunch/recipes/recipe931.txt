Preheat a lightly greased waffle iron.    
In a medium bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.    
In a separate medium bowl, mix egg yolk, sour cream, coconut milk, pineapple and butter. Thoroughly mix in the flour mixture. Gently fold in egg whites.    
Pour the mixture into the prepared waffle iron, and cook until golden brown.
