Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla in a large bowl. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture, mixing well to make a smooth batter. Stir in butter and cooked wild rice.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.    
For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter on griddle and cook until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Continue with remaining batter.
