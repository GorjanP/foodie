Bring 3 inches of water in a large pot of water to a boil. You may also do this with a wok and steamer baskets.    
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, spinach, garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger, green onion, cilantro and salt. Place a spoonful of the filling onto a wonton wrapper; fold and crimp to seal. If necessary, wet the edges with water. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.    
Set a steamer tray in the pot, and place the momos on the steamer. Steam over rapidly boiling water for 30 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce.    
To make the dipping sauce, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili oil and grated ginger in a small bowl.
