Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Cut each pita bread into 8 triangles. Place triangles on lined cookie sheet.    
In a small bowl, combine the oil, pepper, salt, basil and chervil.  Brush each triangle with oil mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven for about 7 minutes, or until lightly browned and crispy. Watch carefully, as they tend to burn easily!
