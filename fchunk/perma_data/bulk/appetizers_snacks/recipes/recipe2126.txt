Place eggs in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then cover and remove from heat. Let stand 10 minutes. Cool under running water, and remove shells. Place hard-cooked eggs in a large jar.    
In a saucepan, combine the onion, water, sugar, and vinegar. Stir in salt, dill, garlic powder, and mustard seed. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. Pour over the eggs in the jar. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 days. The eggs will be yellow!
