Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place potatoes in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover. Bring to boil, and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain, and cool in a bowl of cold water.    
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain, crumble, and set aside.    
Remove cooled potatoes from water. Pat dry with a paper towel, and cut in half.  Using a small spoon, carefully remove a small amount from center, leaving approximately 1/4 inch rim around each potato. Set reserved potato aside.    
In a bowl, mix together reserved potato, sour cream, bacon, seasoned salt, pepper, and chives. Spoon a small amount of mixture into each potato half and place on a baking sheet. Top each potato off with some shredded cheese.    
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and potatoes are warmed through. Garnish with parsley, and serve.
