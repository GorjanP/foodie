In a bowl, stir together the yogurt, softened cream cheese, feta cheese, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste; mix until smooth.    
Spread mixture into a shallow serving or baking dish. Cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours, or overnight.    
To serve, scatter cucumber, tomatoes, green onion, and sliced olives on top, and season with pepper as desired. Spoon onto pita wedges.
