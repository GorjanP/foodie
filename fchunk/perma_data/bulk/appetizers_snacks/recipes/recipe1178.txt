Soak onion rings in a bowl of ice water for 1 hour; drain and pat dry with paper towels.    
Whisk 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.    
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Dip onion rings in the batter, working in batches, until evenly coated and arrange in 1 layer on a plate.    
Fry the battered onion rings, working in batches, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried onion rings to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
