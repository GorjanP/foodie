Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat cream cheese and mayonnaise until smooth. Stir in the crabmeat, minced onion, lemon juice and Tabasco sauce. Spoon mixture into a small oven-proof dish that has been sprayed with cooking spray.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly. Serve with crackers, potato chips or tortilla chips. You can also use fresh crabmeat in place of the canned crabmeat.
