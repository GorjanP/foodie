Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place cream cheese in a large bowl; add chopped meat and sauerkraut, sweet pickle relish, mayonnaise, sour cream, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and shredded cheese. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon until well blended, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Transfer mixture to an ovenproof baking dish. Distribute evenly and smooth out the top. To increase the surface exposure, add texture, and encourage browning, roughen up the surface a bit with the tines of a fork.    
Bake in preheated oven until bubbling and browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving, about 15 minutes.
