Place spicy ground pork sausage, onion and dried beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until sausage is evenly brown and onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.    
Mix sauerkraut, prepared mustard, parsley, cream cheese and garlic salt with the sausage mixture. Cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 2 hours.    
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Place flour in a small bowl. Blend milk and egg together in another small bowl. Place seasoned bread crumbs in a medium bowl.    
Roll the chilled sausage mixture into 1 inch balls. Dredge sausage balls one at a time in flour, the egg and milk mixture and the bread crumbs.    
In small batches deep fry sausage balls in the preheated oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm, or freeze for later use.
