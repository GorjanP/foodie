Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large skillet over medium heat, begin to brown the ground turkey. Stir in garlic, pepper, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 1 tablespoon chives. Stir in 1 tablespoon hot sauce. When the turkey is browned, stir in taco seasoning mix according to package instructions.    
Pour the beans into a microwave safe bowl, and heat in the microwave until softened. Stir in 1 tablespoon chives and 1 tablespoon hot sauce.    
Spread the tortilla chips across the bottom of a baking sheet. Spoon the beans mixture over the chips. Then spread the turkey mixture across the top. Sprinkle cheese, then olives, tomatoes, green onions, and remaining 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes over the top.    
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes
