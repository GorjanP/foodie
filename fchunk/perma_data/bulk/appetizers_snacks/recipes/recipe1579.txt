Place chicken in a large, deep skillet with 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Cook over medium high heat until no longer pink. Drain and set aside.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Separate crescent roll dough into individual triangles. Place triangles in a single layer on a large baking sheet.    
In a small bowl, mix 3 teaspoons reserved pineapple juice, honey and ground ginger.    
Brush each crescent roll dough triangle with the pineapple juice mixture. Place one pineapple chunk and approximately 1 tablespoon chicken meat on each triangle. Roll and seal each triangle individually.    
Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
