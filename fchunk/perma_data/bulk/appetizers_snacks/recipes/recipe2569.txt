Place the tomatillos, tomatoes, oil, chili pepper, shallots, cilantro, vinegar, garlic powder, and salt in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the tomatillos have softened.  Pour into a blender, and puree until smooth.  Chill and serve.
