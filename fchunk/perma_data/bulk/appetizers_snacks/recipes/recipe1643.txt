Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cream cheese, sour cream, refried beans, and taco seasoning in a bowl. Fold jalapeno pepper into the dip; spread into a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Top with shredded cheese and continue cooking until the cheese has melted, about 5 more minutes.
