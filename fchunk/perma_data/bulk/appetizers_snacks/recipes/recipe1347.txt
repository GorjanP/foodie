Mix together the cream cheese, shredded Cheddar, green onion, Worcestershire sauce, and taco seasoning mix  in a large bowl. Press the cheese mixture into a ball, turn it out onto a sheet of plastic wrap.    
Use the plastic wrap to press the cheese ball into the shape of a football by flattening the ball and rounding each end. Place the cheese football on a plate, arrange the strips of American cheese like laces on the top of the cheese football. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.    
Remove the cheese ball from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving.
