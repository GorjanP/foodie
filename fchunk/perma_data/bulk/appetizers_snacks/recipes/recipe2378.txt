Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.    
Place broken pretzels in a large baking pan or roaster. Combine corn oil, ranch dressing mix, Cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper and dill. Pour over pretzels; stir to coat evenly.    
Bake for 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Remove from oven and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil. Store in tightly covered container.
