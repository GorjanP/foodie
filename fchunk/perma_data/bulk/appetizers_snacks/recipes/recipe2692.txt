Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Beat egg in a small bowl. Place flour in a separate small bowl. Toss bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a another separate bowl.    
Gently press each cheese stick into flour to coat and shake off excess flour. Dip into egg, then press into bread crumb mixture. Place the breaded cheese sticks onto a baking sheet while breading the rest; do not stack. Coat each cheese stick with olive oil; cover baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 4 minutes.
