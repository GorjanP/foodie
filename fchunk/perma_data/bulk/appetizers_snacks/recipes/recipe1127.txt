Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine sausage, 1 cup shredded cheese, ricotta cheese, onions and tomatoes in large bowl.    
Brush tops of mushroom caps with oil; place, top-sides down, in shallow baking pan.    
Top with sausage mixture.  Drizzle with vinegar, if desired.  Sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.    
Bake 10-12 minutes or until mushrooms are tender.
