Place the chicken wings, garlic, and onion into a large bowl. Pour in soy sauce, fish sauce, lemon juice, and sesame oil. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and sugar; toss together until well coated. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil.    
Remove wings from marinade, reserving extra. Arrange wings in a single layer over bottom of prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven, turning once and brushing with reserved marinade, until deep, golden brown and meat juices run clear, approximately 30 minutes.
