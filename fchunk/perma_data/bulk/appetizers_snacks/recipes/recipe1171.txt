Spread almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in a cold oven.    
Turn oven on to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake almonds, stirring occasionally, until light tan and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. The nuts will continue to cook after removing from oven.    
Meanwhile, mix sugar and salt together in a small bowl; sprinkle about 1 tablespoon sugar mixture into a large bowl.    
Stir honey, water, and almond oil together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add almonds; cook and stir until almonds have absorbed all the liquid, about 5 minutes.    
Transfer coated almonds to the large bowl sprinkled with sugar mixture. Sprinkle remaining sugar mixture over almonds; toss to coat evenly.    
Spread almonds onto waxed paper to cool completely. Store at room temperature in a tightly covered container or plastic bag.
