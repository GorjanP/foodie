Toss Emmentaler cheese, Gruyere cheese, cornstarch, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.    
Pour beer into a heavy pot over medium-low heat; bring to a simmer until gently warmed, about 5 minutes.    
Stir cheese mixture into simmering beer in small amounts, assuring each addition melts fully into the mixture and that the mixture has returned to a simmer before adding the next batch, 10 to 15 minutes total.    
Stir mustard into the cheese mixture and remove pot from heat. Taste fondue and adjust seasonings to taste. Pour fondue into a fondue dish. Serve with the baguette.
