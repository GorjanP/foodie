Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking sheet.    
Stir water, teff flour, and tapioca flour together in a bowl until smooth; add sunflower seeds, pepitas, sesame seeds, flax seeds, teff, black sesame seeds, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir until mixture is soupy. Pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, tapping pan on the counter to evenly distribute mixture in the pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crackers are crisp, about 40 minutes. Sprinkle salt over warm crackers.
