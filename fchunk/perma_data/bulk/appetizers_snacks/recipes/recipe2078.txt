Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Place cashews on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes.    
Stir rosemary, margarine, brown sugar, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl.    
Pour warm cashews into the rosemary mixture and toss to coat. Serve warm or allow to cool and store in an airtight container.
