Mix peanut butter, powdered milk, and honey together in a bowl until mixture resembles a soft dough. This will be the 'flesh' of the fingers.    
Mold enough dough around each pretzel rod, making sure to cover the ends. The pretzels will be the 'bones' of the fingers.    
Use the tip of a teaspoon the make marks on the 'flesh' similar to knuckles.    
Push 1 sliced almond onto 1 end of each 'finger' to resemble a finger nail.    
Place jam in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until softened, 20 to 30 seconds. Dip the end opposite the 'finger nail' into the jam for the 'blood'.
