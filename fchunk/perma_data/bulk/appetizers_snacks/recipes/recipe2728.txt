Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spread butter onto 1 side of each baguette slice.    
Mix avocados, tomatoes, and onion in a bowl until smooth and consistent in texture; scoop onto butter-side of baguette slices. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over avocado mixture layer. Arrange baguette slices on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 7 minutes.
