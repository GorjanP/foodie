Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut aluminum foil into 3 6-inch squares (large enough to wrap each garlic head).  Place 2 teaspoons of butter in each square of foil and place one garlic head into each square of foil. Fold the packets up, and arrange them in a 9 inch pie pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the garlic is soft.
