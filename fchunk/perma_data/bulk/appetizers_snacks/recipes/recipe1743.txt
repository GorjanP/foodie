Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.    
While the grill is heating, slice the pork tenderloin into flat strips similar to the bacon. Roll up strips of bacon inside strips of pork tenderloin and secure with moistened toothpicks. Season with salt and pepper.    
Grill the rolls for about 10 minutes on one side, then turn over. Slather some barbeque sauce over them and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from the grill and let rest for 2 minutes before serving.
