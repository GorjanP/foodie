Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie plate.    
In a medium bowl, beat eggs until light. Mix in flour, wine, milk, salt, green onion, Swiss cheese and butter or margarine. Pour mixture into prepared pie plate, and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.  Let cool, slice into 16 wedges, and serve.
