Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.    
Remove stems from mushrooms. Finely chop stems, and set aside. Arrange caps cavity side up in the baking dish.    
In a medium bowl, mix mushroom stems, cooked baby shrimp, crushed bacon flavored crackers and cream cheese.    
Stuff mushroom caps generously with the mushroom stem mixture. Top with sharp Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
