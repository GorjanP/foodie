Adjust oven rack to center; heat oven to 450 degrees.    
Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and apple until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add spices; saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken, tomatoes, raisins and olives; simmer until filling is thick and moist but not too liquid, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Stir in garlic, almonds, salt and pepper. Transfer to a medium bowl; cool to room temperature.    
Separate biscuits onto a cornmeal-coated work surface. Sprinkle with cornmeal as necessary, and roll each one into a 5 inch circle. Fill each one, using a scant 2 Tbs. filling and leaving a 1/2-inch border. Place on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. (At this point, can be frozen up to 2 weeks.)    
Brush tops with oil. Bake until golden, 16 to 20 minutes (longer if frozen).
