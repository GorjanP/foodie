Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the sausage in a large bowl and mix in the chestnuts, green onion, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, eggs, garlic powder, and breadcrumbs. Roll the mixture into 1 to 1 1/2 inch balls and place on a broiler pan.  Bake in the oven for 1 hour.  When done, place the meatballs in a slow cooker.    
While meatballs are cooking, prepare the sweet and sour sauce by stirring together the sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepan.  Pour in vinegar, pineapple juice, ketchup, and soy sauce to taste.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened.  Pour sauce over meatballs, and keep warm in the slow cooker.
