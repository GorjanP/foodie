Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch tart pan with butter.    
Lay the pie crust into the prepared tart pan. Whisk leaves from 3 sprigs oregano and 3 sprigs thyme with Dijon mustard, honey, garlic, and olive oil to a creamy paste. Spread mixture over the bottom of the pie crust to completely cover. Lay tomato slices over the mustard mixture, covering the bottom of the crust. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the tart; top with leaves from 1 sprig oregano and 1 sprig thyme.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
