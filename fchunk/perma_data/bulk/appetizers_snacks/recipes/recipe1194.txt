Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).    
Pour the butter into a medium bowl, and mix in the pecans. Stir until the pecans are well coated.    
Arrange coated pecans in a single layer on one or two medium baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt.    
Bake in the preheated oven approximately 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, cool and store in covered containers.
