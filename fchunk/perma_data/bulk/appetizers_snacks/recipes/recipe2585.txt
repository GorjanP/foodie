Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place the yuca fries in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Turn occasionally to brown them evenly. Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon or spatula and season with salt. Squeeze lime juice over them if you like and serve immediately.
