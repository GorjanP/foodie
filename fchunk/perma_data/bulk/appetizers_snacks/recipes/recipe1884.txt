Combine the water, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, sugar, limes, and red pepper in a gallon-sized sealable bag; seal and shake to combine. Add the chicken wings; refrigerate 24 to 48 hours.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil grate.    
Drain the marinade from the wings and discard. Cook the wings on the heated grill, turning occasionally, until juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes.
