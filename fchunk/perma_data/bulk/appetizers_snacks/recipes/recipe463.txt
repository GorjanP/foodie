Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, imitation crabmeat, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and green onions.    
Place approximately 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper.    
Place egg whites in a small bowl. Using the fingers, spread egg white over two edges of the wonton wrappers. Fold into triangles and press to seal edges.    
In small batches, deep fry the wontons until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
