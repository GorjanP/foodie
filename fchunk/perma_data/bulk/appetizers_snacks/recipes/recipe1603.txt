In a large bowl, stir together the bacon, chicken, shrimp and bean sprouts. Season with soy sauce and garlic salt, and mix until well blended. Place a few generous teaspoons onto the center of one egg roll wrapper at a time, and roll up according to the package directions.    
Heat enough oil to cover the rolls completely in a large heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fry rolls a few at a time, turning once, until golden brown. Remove with tongs to drain on paper towels. They are delicious plain, or with plum sauce for dipping.
