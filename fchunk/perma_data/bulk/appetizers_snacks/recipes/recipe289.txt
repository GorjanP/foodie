Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Bake wings in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cooked through and crispy.    
Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine melted butter, red pepper sauce, tomato sauce, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Mix together.    
When wings are baked, dip in sauce to coat well, then shake off excess and return coated wings to baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake for another 15 minutes to set sauce.
