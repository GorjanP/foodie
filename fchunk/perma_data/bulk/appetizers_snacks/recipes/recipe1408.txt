Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
Split the English muffins in half and set aside.    
In a mixing bowl, combine the shrimp, softened butter, cheese spread, mayonnaise, garlic powder and seasoned salt. Spread the mixture onto the English muffin halves. Slice each half into 6 or 8 triangles. Place the triangles on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, until the mixture begins to melt. Serve immediately.
