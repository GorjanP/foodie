Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Fill mushroom caps with crumbled blue cheese.    
Place onion slices and mushrooms (cheese side up) onto the prepared grill. Turn onions over frequently until tender. Do not turn over mushrooms. Grill until blue cheese has melted, and mushrooms are tender. Remove mushrooms to a serving plate, and top with grilled onions.
