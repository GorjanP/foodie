Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, green onions, clams and lemon juice. Cut the top out of the bread and hollow the bread out. Pour the clam mixture into the bread bowl and place the bread top back on the bread bowl.    
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 60 minutes. Serve with the bread you removed from the loaf when hollowing it out.
