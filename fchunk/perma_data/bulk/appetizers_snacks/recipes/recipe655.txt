Melt butter in a 4 quart glass casserole dish in the microwave. Stir in the brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and water. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir in the nuts so they are well coated. Microwave for 4 to 5  additional minutes on high, stirring every minute.  Spread cooked nuts out onto parchment or waxed paper to cool.
