In a skillet, cook and crumble sausage over medium heat until no longer pink and lightly browned; drain.  In a large bowl, combine sausage, cheese, baking mix, onion, mushrooms and milk; mix well.  Shape mixture into 36 walnut-size balls and place on a greased, shallow baking dish.    
Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.    
Serve with barbeque or chutney sauce.
