Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut wings in half, dip in egg and coat with flour.    
Heat butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry wings until deep brown.  Place in a shallow roasting pan.    
In a small bowl combine soy sauce, water, sugar, vinegar, garlic powder and salt.  Pour over wings.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, basting wings with sauce often.
