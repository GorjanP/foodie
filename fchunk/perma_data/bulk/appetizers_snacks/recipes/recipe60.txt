Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Place sausage in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease.    
In a bowl, mix the sausage, cream cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Spoon about 1 tablespoon sausage mixture into each jalapeno half. Arrange stuffed halves in baking dishes.    
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned. Serve with Ranch dressing.
