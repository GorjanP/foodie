Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.    
Arrange the dinner roll dough in 4 rectangles on the baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.    
In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, mayonnaise and dry ranch-style dressing mix. Spread evenly on the crescent rolls. Sprinkle with broccoli and tomatoes. Top with Cheddar cheese and serve.
