Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
In a medium bowl, combine the crabmeat, green onions, cheese, mayonnaise, curry powder, salt and lemon juice. Mix well.    
Separate each refrigerator roll into three layers, making 36 pieces total. Place the pieces on the prepared baking sheet. Spoon a small amount of the crabmeat mixture onto each pieces of dough.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 12 minutes, until puffed and brown. Serve hot.
