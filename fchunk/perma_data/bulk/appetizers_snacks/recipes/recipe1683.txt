Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Unwrap each tube of biscuit dough and lay the two 'logs' on a baking sheet in the same formation they were in the can. Gently separate biscuits, keeping them still attached on the bottom, just enough to sprinkle Cheddar cheese between each biscuit.    
Stir melted butter and garlic salt together in a small bowl; drizzle evenly over each biscuit 'log'. Sprinkle with chives.    
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuit tops are golden and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes.
