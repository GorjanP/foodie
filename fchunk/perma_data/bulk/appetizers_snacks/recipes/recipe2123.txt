Preheat the grill for high heat.    
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and mix in the garlic, blue cheese, herbes de Provence, red pepper, sea salt, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.    
Dunk each baguette slice in the butter mixture to thoroughly coat. Place slices in a bowl, and toss with any remaining butter mixture.    
Place the baguette slices on the prepared grill, and toast 1 minute on both sides, or to desired doneness.
