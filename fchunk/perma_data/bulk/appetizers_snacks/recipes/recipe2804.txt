Preheat the broiler.    
On a medium baking sheet, arrange tomatoes, garlic and onion. Place under the broiler. Checking frequently, heat 15 minutes, or until vegetables are charred. Remove from heat and allow to cool approximately 10 minutes.    
Place charred vegetables in a blender or food processor with the water and blend until smooth. Stir in ground black pepper, hot pepper sauce, salt and hot chile sauce. Refrigerate the mixture until serving.
