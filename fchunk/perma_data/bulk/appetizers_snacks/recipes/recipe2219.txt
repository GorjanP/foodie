To make schmear, combine cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, capers, red onion, garlic, and lemon juice in a bowl; stir well to combine.    
Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour (or longer) so flavors can meld.    
To prepare, spread 1-1/2 tsp. schmear on RITZ Everything Cracker and top with cucumber half and piece of smoked salmon.
