Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and add the Italian sausage, sliced pepperoni and crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook and stir until the sausage is well browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Drain fat from skillet. Stir in the spaghetti sauce and salsa.  Cook until meat and sauce are hot, about 5 minutes.    
Spread the tortilla chips on a very large platter.  Spoon the hot meat sauce evenly over the chips and top with the feta cheese, chopped onions, jalapenos, black olives, and sour cream.
