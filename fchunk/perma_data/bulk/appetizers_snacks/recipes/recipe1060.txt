Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine turkey, onion, bread crumbs, egg, curry powder, salt, cumin, ginger, and cinnamon together in a bowl using your hands; form into about 20 balls.    
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook meatballs, working in batches, in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned meatballs to a baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
