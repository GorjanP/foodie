Heat safflower oil in a large, heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix together flour and baking powder in a small bowl. In another bowl, whisk together eggs and heavy cream. Place seasoned bread crumbs on a medium, flat dish. Dust Spanish onion rings with flour mixture. Dip one at a time into egg mixture. Coat thoroughly with bread crumbs.    
Fry coated rings in the hot oil, a few at a time, until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
