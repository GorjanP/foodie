Heat oil in large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together cooked crabmeat, cream cheese and garlic salt.    
Roll a small amount of the crabmeat mixture inside each won ton wrapper and seal.    
In small batches, carefully place won tons into the hot oil. Fry 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
