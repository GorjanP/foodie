Sprinkle parsley in a shallow baking dish. Set aside.    
Mix Mexican cheese blend, cream cheese, mayonnaise, taco seasoning, and jalapeno peppers in a large bowl until well blended. Divide the mixture into 3 portions, and roll each portion into a ball. Roll each ball in the parsley until completely covered. Wrap individually with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
