Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Spread about 1 to 2 teaspoons cream cheese onto each salami slice. Roll salami around cream cheese and stuff into each banana pepper. Place stuffed peppers on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 30 to 40 minutes.
