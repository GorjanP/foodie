Cover a large area of counter space with waxed paper and tape it down.    
Mix pretzels, corn cereal squares, peanuts, and candy-coated milk chocolate pieces together in a large bowl.    
Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Pour melted white chocolate over pretzel mixture; stir to evenly coat. Quickly transfer mixture to the prepared waxed paper and spread in a thin layer; cool completely. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.
