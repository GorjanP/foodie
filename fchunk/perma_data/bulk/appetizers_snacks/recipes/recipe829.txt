Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.    
Arrange sweet potato slices in a single layer onto baking sheets.  Stir together butter, salt, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl; brush onto sweet potato slices.    
Bake in preheated oven until edges curl upwards, about 20 to 25 minutes.
