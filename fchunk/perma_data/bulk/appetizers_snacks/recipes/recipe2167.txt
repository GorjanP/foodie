Slice shrimp down the back as deep as you can without cutting through, to make a nice opening for stuffing. Set aside.    
In a medium bowl, mix together the crabmeat, chili sauce, horseradish, hot pepper sauce and capers. Mix in enough of the cream cheese to form a sticky paste.    
Stuff the openings of each shrimp with about 1 tablespoon of the crab salad. Sprinkle paprika over the top. Chill for about 30 minutes before serving.
