Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Blend cream cheese, mayonnaise, and onion in a bowl using a hand mixer. Gently fold artichoke hearts and imitation crab, Monterey Jack cheese, and Parmesan cheese into the cream cheese mixture; spread into a pie plate.    
Bake in preheated oven until browned and bubbling on top, 15 to 20 minutes.
