Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a mini muffin pan.    
In a skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels. Crumble bacon into a medium mixing bowl; add chopped tomato, onion, Swiss cheese, mayonnaise, and basil.    
Separate biscuits into halves horizontally. Place each half into prepared mini muffin pan. Fill each biscuit half with the bacon mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
