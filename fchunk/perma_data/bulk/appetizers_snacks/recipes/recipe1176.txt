Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Fill each jalapeno pepper half with cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and bread crumbs, respectively, and arrange peppers on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until jalapenos are tender and cheese melts, about 20 minutes.
