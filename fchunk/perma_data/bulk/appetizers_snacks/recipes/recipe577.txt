Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Beat egg whites until soft peaks begin to form.  Add sugar, salt and vanilla; beat until stiff peaks form and turn glossy.  Fold in nuts and coat well with the egg white mixture.    
Melt butter in a 9x13 inch baking pan by placing pan in the oven.  Evenly spread coated nuts over melted butter in pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes, stirring and turning nuts about every 8 minutes, or until butter no longer remains in pan.  Place hot nuts on foil and allow to cool.  May be stored in an airtight container for several weeks!
