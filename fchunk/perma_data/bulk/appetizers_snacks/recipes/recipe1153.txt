Combine chicken and almonds and set aside. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
In a large saucepan, combine the chicken broth, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, seasoned salt, celery seed and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil. Add flour all at once; stir mixture until a smooth ball forms. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes.    
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat until smooth. Stir in chicken and almonds. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto greased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
