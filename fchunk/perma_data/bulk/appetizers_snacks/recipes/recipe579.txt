In a large bowl, mix together chopped spinach, dry bread stuffing mix, eggs, Parmesan cheese, onion, butter and Cheddar cheese. Cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 30 minutes.    
Drop the mixture by rounded spoonfuls onto a lightly greased large baking sheet. Place baking sheet in the freezer approximately 1 hour.    
When ready to bake, allow the balls to partially thaw, about 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.    
Bake the balls in the preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned.
