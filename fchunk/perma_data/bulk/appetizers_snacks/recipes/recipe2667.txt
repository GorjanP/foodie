Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cauliflower in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.    
Mix cauliflower, cucumber, onion, tomato, cilantro, and serrano chile peppers together in a large bowl. Add vegetable juice, lime juice, chili powder, soy-based seasoning, and Worcestershire sauce, respectively, stirring after each addition. Season with salt.
