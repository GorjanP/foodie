Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Bake potatoes in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until tender. Remove from heat.    
Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut baked potatoes in half. Scoop out potato, leaving a small layer on the skins. Cut halves into four strips. Place strips on a medium baking sheet.    
Sprinkle 1 cup Gouda cheese thinly over potato strips. Top with pepperoni, followed by green onions and remaining Gouda cheese.    
Bake topped potato strips in the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven 30 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
