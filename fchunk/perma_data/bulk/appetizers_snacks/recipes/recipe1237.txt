Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    
Line a 9-inch square pan with foil, extending the foil over the sides.    
Grease the foil with shortening or butter.    
Mix the first 4 ingredients in a bowl.    
Heat the butter, brown sugar and honey in a saucepan until the butter melts and begins to boil.    
Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients and mix until well coated.   Transfer to the prepared pan and press evenly with a spatula.    
Bake about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown.    
Cool on rack.  Using the foil, lift out of the pan and place on cutting board.  Cut into 18 bars.
