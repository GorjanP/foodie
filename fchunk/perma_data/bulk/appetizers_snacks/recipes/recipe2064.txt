Place the crawfish tails into a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. Set aside.    
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the crawfish tails, garlic, crab boil, salt and Old Bay seasoning. Cook and stir until garlic is toasted. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream cheese until it has melted. Serve the dip warm or refrigerate and serve chilled.
