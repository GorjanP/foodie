Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
Place unpeeled garlic cloves in the middle of a large square of aluminum foil. Drizzle cloves with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; wrap in foil.  Roast in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from the oven, and allow to cool. When slightly cooled, squeeze roasted garlic out of peels.    
Combine roasted garlic, garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, salt, and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the work bowl of a food processor.  Process until very creamy.
