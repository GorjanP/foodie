In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, mayonnaise, green olives, black olives and green onions.    
Spread cream cheese mixture in a thin layer onto each tortilla. Roll up tortillas.  Chill about 1 hour, or until the filling is firm.    
Slice chilled rollups into 1 inch pieces. Serve with salsa for dipping.
