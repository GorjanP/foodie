Melt butter with olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook until caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the onion to a bowl, and mix with the grated turnip. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to mingle. Serve on small toast  or crackers.
