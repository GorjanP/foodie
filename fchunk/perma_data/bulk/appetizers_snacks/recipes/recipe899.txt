Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking dish.    
In a medium bowl, mix together sweet onions, mayonnaise and Swiss cheese.    
Transfer mixture to the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 20 to 30 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned. Cool before serving.
