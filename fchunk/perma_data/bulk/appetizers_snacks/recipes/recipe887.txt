Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil or parchment paper.    
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, and cayenne pepper. Stir and bring to a boil; let boil 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat; gently stir in nuts until evenly coated and the sugar mixture begins to thicken. Spread nuts over the prepared baking pan. Bake until browned, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven and let nuts cool. Place in a plastic bag, and gently tumble together to remove any excess glaze. Serve warm or store in an airtight container.
