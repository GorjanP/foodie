Whisk soy sauce and honey together in a large bowl; add bananas and stir to coat bananas in marinade. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove banana chunks and reserve marinade.    
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Wrap bananas with bacon and secure by threading a toothpick through the bacon. Dip wrapped bananas in reserved marinade and arrange on a baking sheet.    
Broil in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.
