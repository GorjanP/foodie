Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking pan lined with foil.    
In a large, shallow bowl, crush the corn cereal to 1 cup. Mix together the corn cereal, oregano and garlic salt.    
Place the flour in a small bowl.    
In another small bowl, thoroughly beat the egg whites and water.    
Cut the mozzarella cheese into 12 sticks approximately 2 3/4 inches in length. Dip the cheese sticks in the flour, then the egg mixture, then the cereal mixture. Repeat dipping in the egg and cereal mixture to ensure a complete coating. Arrange cheese sticks on the baking pan. Allow the sticks to set for 30 minutes.    
Bake in the preheated oven about 8 minutes until cheese is soft and sticks are lightly browned.
