Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Mix chicken, French-fried onions, cilantro, oats, white onion, bell pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; shape into golf ball-sized spheres and arrange onto prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).    
Stir ranch dressing and hot sauce together in a bowl until consistent in color; serve with meatballs.
