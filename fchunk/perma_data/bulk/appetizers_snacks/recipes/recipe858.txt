Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Place a skillet over medium-high heat; add sausage and cook until brown; drain and return pan to heat. Stir the cream cheese into the sausage and cook until completely melted; remove from heat.    
Spoon equal portions of the sausage mixture into the jalapeno halves and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the stuffed peppers.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the peppers are soft and the tops are lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
