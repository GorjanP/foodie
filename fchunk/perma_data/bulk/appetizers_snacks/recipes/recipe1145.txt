Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Flake the tuna into a medium bowl. Mix in the mayonnaise, celery salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. Stir in celery, onion, and yellow bell pepper.    
Butter English muffin halves, place them on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.    
Spoon tuna mixture onto each muffin half and top each with a slice of cheese. Return to the oven and continue baking until the cheese has melted, about 8 minutes. Top each with a tomato slice before serving.
