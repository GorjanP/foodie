Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Open pita bread halves and roughly cut into approximately 2 inch pieces. Arrange on a medium baking sheet.    
In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and mix in garlic and dried Italian-style seasoning. Pour the mixture over pita bread pieces.    
Sprinkle bread with Parmesan cheese, adjusting the amount as desired. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
