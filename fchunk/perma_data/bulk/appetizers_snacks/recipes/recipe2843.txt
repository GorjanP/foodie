Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Mix cream cheese and brown sugar together in a small bowl; spread over bacon slice. Roll up and transfer to the baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.
