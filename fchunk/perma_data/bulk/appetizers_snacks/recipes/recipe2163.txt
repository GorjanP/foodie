Spread refried beans evenly on a medium sized serving platter. If the beans are watery, chill for 20 to 30 minutes.    
Peel the avocados and remove the pits. In a food processor, blend the avocados with the mayonnaise, sour cream and taco seasoning until smooth. Pour over the refried beans. Top with cheddar cheese. Add lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, green pepper and black olives if desired. Refrigerate until serving. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips.
