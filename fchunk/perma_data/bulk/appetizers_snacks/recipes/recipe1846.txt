Pierce the eggplant 4 or 5 times with the tip of a paring knife.  Microwave on High for 6 to 8 minutes until softened, then place on a plate, and allow to cool to room temperature.    
Peel off the skin and stem, discard.  Roughly chop the eggplant and place into the bowl of a blender along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil.  Puree until smooth, adding water if needed to make a thick paste; season to taste with salt.
