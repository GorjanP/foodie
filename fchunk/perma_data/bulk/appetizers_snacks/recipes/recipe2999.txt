Place corn in a saucepan and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and return corn to saucepan.    
Spoon 3/4 cup corn into 10 serving bowls; add 2 tablespoons butter to each and stir until butter is melted. Mix 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup crema Mexicana into each bowl; sprinkle a generous amount of chili powder over each. Season with salt.    
Top each serving with 2 tablespoons cotija cheese and hot sauce; garnish with a lime wedge.
