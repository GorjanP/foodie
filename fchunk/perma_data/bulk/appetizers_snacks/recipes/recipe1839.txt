Mix the turkey, cranberries, almonds, and cranberry sauce in a bowl. Place about 1 teaspoon of the mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper. Fold wrappers over filling, moisten edges, and press with a fork to seal.    
Heat the oil in large skillet or deep fryer.    
Fry the wontons in the hot oil until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
