Beat cream cheese and blue cheese in large mixing bowl until light and fluffy--about 5 minutes.  Mix in 1 cup sour cream and pepper.  Add eggs - one at a time - mixing well after each addition.    
Pour mixture into buttered 9 inch springform pan.  Bake 60 - 65 minutes or until wooden pick inserted near center comes out clean.
