In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, dry bread crumbs and milk. Blend in ground pepper, parsley, onion, salt, egg and Worcestershire sauce. Mix thoroughly.    
Shape the beef mixture into 1 inch meatballs. In a large skillet, melt the shortening over medium heat and brown the meatballs.    
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, mix the chile sauce and grape jelly over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until jelly is melted.    
Pour the sauce over the browning meatballs and simmer for 30 minutes, or until meatballs are thoroughly cooked.
