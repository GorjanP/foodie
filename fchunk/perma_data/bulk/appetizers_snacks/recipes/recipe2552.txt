Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Wrap each prune with one of the pieces of bacon. Thread three of the wrapped prunes onto each skewer. Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is crisp, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
