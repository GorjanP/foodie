Combine honey, mustard , lemon juice, curry powder, garlic, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag.  Add chicken wings, and marinate at least 1 hour in refrigerator.    
Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds by placing on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, shaking to toss occasionally.    
Remove wings from marinade.  Broil for 5 to 10 minutes on each side, or until well cooked.  Baste with marinade every few minutes.  Remove from oven, and sprinkle liberally with the sesame seeds.
