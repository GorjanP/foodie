Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut Brie cheese round in half lengthwise, creating two thinner wheels. Spread crushed garlic on cut surface of 1 half; top garlic layer with 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper jelly. Place the other Brie cheese half on top of filling. Spread remaining 1 tablespoon red pepper jelly on top of Brie cheese; place in a round casserole dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until rind begins to soften, about 15 minutes.
