Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Beat butter, garlic, basil, and salt together in a bowl until smooth. Spread butter mixture onto each half of bread. Wrap each half of bread in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crusty, about 20 minutes.
