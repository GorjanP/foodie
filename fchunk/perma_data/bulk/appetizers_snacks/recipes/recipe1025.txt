Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Mix mild sausage and hot sausage in a large bowl until evenly blended.    
Stir Cheddar cheese into sausage mixture.    
Mix biscuit baking mix into sausage mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until baking mix is moist.    
Roll meat mixture into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch balls.    
Arrange meatballs on prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and cheese is browned, about 20 minutes.
