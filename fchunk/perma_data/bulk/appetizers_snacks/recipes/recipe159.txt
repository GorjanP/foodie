Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Mix sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.    
Whisk egg white and water together in a separate bowl until frothy. Toss pecans in the egg white mixture. Mix sugar mixture into pecan mixture until pecans are evenly coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned, 1 hour.
