Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, combine green onions and jalapeno. Stir in pressed garlic.    
In an 8x10 inch glass baking dish, mix sour cream and mayonnaise. Stir in green onions mixture. Blend in 1 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Stir in spinach and artichokes. Spread mixture evenly across the baking dish. Sprinkle lemon juice on top, and cover with aluminum foil.    
Bake in a preheated oven about 20 minutes. Remove, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Return to oven, and bake until lightly browned, about 5 minutes more.
