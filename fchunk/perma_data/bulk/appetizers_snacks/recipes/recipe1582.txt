Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x 7 inch casserole dish.    
Place shrimp evenly in the casserole dish. Pour wine over the shrimp.    
Mix together butter, garlic, cayenne pepper, paprika, parsley and bread crumbs. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture over the shrimp. Refrigerate now if desired.    
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until shrimp are firm and topping is golden brown. Serve immediately.
