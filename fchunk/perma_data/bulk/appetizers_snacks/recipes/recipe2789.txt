Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Place the baguette slices on an ungreased, foil-lined baking sheet.    
Bake the bread in the preheated oven until the bottoms are brown, about 5 minutes; flip and bake until crisp, 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven.    
Spread 1 tablespoon of ricotta on each slice of toasted bread. Place a few ribbons of basil on each, arrange a slice of fig on top, and drizzle the finished crostini with balsamic vinegar.
