Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together the green onions and cream cheese . Stuff mushroom caps with the cheese mixture. Wrap each mushroom with a half-slice of bacon, and secure with toothpicks. Place on a baking sheet.    
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is cooked through.
