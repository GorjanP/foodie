Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.    
In a small bowl, mix together cheese, butter, flour, and Worcestershire sauce. Knead the dough. Pinch the dough into small balls, flatten them in the palm of your hand, then roll each circle of dough around one stuffed olive. Arrange the wrapped olives on the prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake for 15 minutes until lightly brown.
