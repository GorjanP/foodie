Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut the bacon slices in half and wrap each half around a scallop. Use a toothpick to secure in place. Drizzle lemon juice over scallops. Place on a cookie sheet.    
Bake in a preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until bacon is cooked.  Serve warm.
