Place the bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat until very crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.  Crumble, and reserve.    
Mix the mayonnaise, sour cream, paprika in a large mixing bowl.  Stir in the bacon and the drained tomatoes. Chill dip at least 6 hours or overnight.
