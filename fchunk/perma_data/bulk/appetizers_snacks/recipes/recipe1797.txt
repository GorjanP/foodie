Place the zucchini in a colander, and sprinkle with salt. Place the colander over a bowl, and refrigerate for one hour to release the liquid from the zucchini.    
In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese and sour cream. Stir in the artichoke hearts, drained zucchini, and black olives. Season with hot sauce, salt, pepper, and pico de gallo seasoning. Serve with crackers, raw vegetables, or corn chips.
