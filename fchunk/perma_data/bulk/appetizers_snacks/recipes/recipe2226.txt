Combine sour cream, avocado, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth and creamy. Transfer into a plastic decorating bottle with a long tip. Refrigerate avocado-cream sauce until needed.    
Place shrimp into a bowl; combine with vegetable oil, ground chipotle pepper, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.    
Place a large nonstick pan over high heat. Cook shrimp in the hot pan in a single layer until barely cooked through and pink, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and let shrimp cool.    
Preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease the foil.    
Lay tortilla chips onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Place 1 shrimp onto each chip. Add 1 slice jalapeno and 1 large pinch pepperjack cheese on top of each shrimp.    
Broil under preheated broiler until cheese is melted and chips are lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Watch carefully; chips will burn quickly.    
Remove nachos from baking sheet and arrange onto a serving platter; drizzle with avocado-cream sauce and sprinkle with cherry tomatoes and cilantro before serving.
