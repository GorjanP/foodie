Preheat the broiler.    
Place ground pork sausage and spicy ground pork sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain sausage. Mix in processed cheese sauce. Arrange pumpernickel party bread slices in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Place even amounts of the sausage mixture on each slice.    
Broil the bread slices 3 to 5 minutes, checking frequently, until toasted.
