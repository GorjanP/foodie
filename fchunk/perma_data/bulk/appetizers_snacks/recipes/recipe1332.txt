Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Fill the jalapeno pepper halves with softened cream cheese, then place a smoked sausage into each pepper on top of the cheese. Wrap each piece with a half strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Place the peppers onto a baking sheet and brush with the barbeque sauce.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is crispy, about 30 minutes.
