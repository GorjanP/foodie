Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Stir together the artichoke hearts, mayonnaise, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Place the dip in a small baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve hot.
