In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese, blue cheese, Cheddar cheese, onion and Worcestershire sauce. Transfer to a separate bowl that has been lined with plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate overnight.    
The next day, gather the cream cheese mixture into a ball. Spread the walnuts out on a dinner plate. Roll the cheese ball in nuts until coated. Refrigerate or serve immediately.
