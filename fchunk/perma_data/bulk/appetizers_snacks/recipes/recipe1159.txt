Soak the vermicelli 30 minutes in warm water; drain.    
In a large bowl, mix the vermicelli, eggs, onion, mushrooms, shrimp, pork, vegetable oil, carrot, crabmeat, bean sprouts, pepper, soy sauce, fish sauce and garlic.    
One by one, moisten the rice wrappers with a damp tea towel and fill with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vermicelli mixture. Roll the wrappers, and allow them to set for 30 minutes.    
In a large saucepan, heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Fry the spring rolls one or two at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
