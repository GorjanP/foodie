Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. Set aside.    
In a medium saucepan heat  butter and water over medium heat until butter melts. Fold in flour all at once, and stir vigorously until a ball forms in the center of the pan. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes.    
Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until fully blended. Mix should be very stiff. Drop by 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon onto prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the moisture disappears. Cool and slit a small opening on one side and stuff with desired filling.
