Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and taco seasoning mix together in a bowl.    
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef with the cumin, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.    
Spread refried beans into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer ground beef mixture over refried beans, lightly pressing beef into beans; top with sour cream mixture.    
Stir salsa and salsa con queso together in a bowl; pour over sour cream mixture layer. Spread Mexican cheese blend, tomato, olives, and green onions, respectively, over sour cream mixture layer.    
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
