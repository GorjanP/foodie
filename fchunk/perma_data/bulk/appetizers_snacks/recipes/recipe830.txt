Cover a plate with parchment paper or wax paper. In a shallow dish, combine buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Place pickles in mixture and set aside.    
Pour the flour, cornmeal, seafood seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning  into a large, resealable plastic bag; shake to mix well. Add pickles a few at a time and tumble gently to coat evenly with the flour mixture. Remove and place on prepared plate.    
Heat oil to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C) in deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet.    
Fry pickles in several batches until golden brown and slightly crisp on the outside with a moist interior, 1 to 2  minutes. Drain on paper towels.    
In a small bowl, combine buttermilk ranch dressing with 1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning; blend. Serve as a dipping sauce for warm pickles.
