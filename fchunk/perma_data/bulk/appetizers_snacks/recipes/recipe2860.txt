Remove string from pods and trim off the blossom end. Make a small slit on flat side of pod.  Soak pods in ice water for about 1 1/2 hours.  Drain and dry pods.    
Put cream cheese in a pastry bag and pipe enough cheese into pods until full.  Arrange pods on a platter lined with spinach or lettuce. Garnish each pod with a bit of cream cheese studded with the appropriate number of peas, depending on how many the mother-to-be is expecting.
