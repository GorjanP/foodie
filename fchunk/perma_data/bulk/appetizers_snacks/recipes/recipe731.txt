Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large roasting pan with foil.    
Shape ground beef into golf sized balls. Arrange them on the large roasting pan.    
Bake the meatballs for 20 to 25 minutes.    
While the meatballs are baking, combine the jelly, chili sauce and lemon juice in a Dutch oven. When the meatballs finish cooking add them to the Dutch oven.    
Cover the oven and simmer on low for 30 minutes. Serve the meatballs hot.
