In a medium bowl mix cream cheese, chopped olives and pepper sauce.    
Spread a thin layer of the mixture on each tortilla. Starting at one end, gently roll tortilla into a tight tube. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill until ready to serve. To serve, slice into 1 inch slices. Serve slices on their side.
