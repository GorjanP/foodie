In a large, resealable bag, mix the orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, hoisin sauce, vegetable oil, sugar, ginger, and fresh garlic. Add chicken wings, seal, and shake to coat evenly. Refrigerate overnight.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Spread wings on foil with marinade, and bake for 45 minutes, until brown and shiny. Transfer to serving platter, and garnish with green onions.
