Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Mix baking mix, Cheddar cheese, sage-flavored pork sausage, and hot pork sausage together in a bowl. Roll mixture into golf ball-sized balls; arrange balls on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the middle and browned on the outside, 25 to 30 minutes.
