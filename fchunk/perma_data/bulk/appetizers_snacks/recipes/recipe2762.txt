Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Mix oats, almond flour, dried fruit, rice cereal, brown sugar, pecans, chocolate chips, flax seeds, instant coffee granules, and cinnamon in a large bowl.    
Whisk applesauce, honey, egg, and vanilla extract in a small bowl; pour into oat mixture. Stir until evenly incorporated. Press batter into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into granola bars.
