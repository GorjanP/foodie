Preheat oven to broil.    
In a medium-size mixing bowl, mix together crabmeat, cheese, mayonnaise, and butter or margarine.  Spread heaping tablespoon of crab mixture on each muffin.  Sprinkle with paprika.  Cut muffins into quarters. Arrange the pieces on a cookie sheet.    
Broil until the crab mixture is bubbly and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm.
