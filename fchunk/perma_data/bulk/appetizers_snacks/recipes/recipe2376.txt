Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.    
Whisk cornstarch, chipotle pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Place chicken wings into the chili mixture; stir  until wings are evenly coated. Arrange wings about an inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top, about 30 minutes; turn wings over and bake an additional 20 minutes.    
Remove wings from oven; drizzle with maple syrup. Return wings to the oven and bake until deeply golden, about 10 minutes more.
