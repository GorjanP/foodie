Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.    
Cook corn on the preheated grill until the kernels are lightly charred but still firm, 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning often. Cut kernels off the cobs, transfer to a large salad bowl, and let cool.    
Mix in tomatoes, avocados, cilantro, white onion, garlic, olive oil, and red wine vinegar; season with kosher salt.
