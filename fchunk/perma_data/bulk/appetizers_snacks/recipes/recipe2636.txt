Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place ground beef and ground sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain fluids.    
In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the processed cheese.    
Mix the melted processed cheese into the meat mixture. Spoon the blended mixture onto cocktail rye bread slices. Arrange slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, until processed cheese begins to brown. Serve warm
