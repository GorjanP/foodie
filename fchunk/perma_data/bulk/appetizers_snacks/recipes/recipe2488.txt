Mix the cream cheese with the onion soup mix in a bowl until smooth. Fill the jalapeno pepper halves with the cheese mixture. Wrap each pepper with a piece of bacon to enclose the filling, and secure with a toothpick.    
Place peppers in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until the bacon is crisp on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly and serve.    
To make the dip, place the sour cream in a bowl, and mix with any leftover cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
