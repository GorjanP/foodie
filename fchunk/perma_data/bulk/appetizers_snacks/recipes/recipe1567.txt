Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Spread cream cheese into jalapeno pepper halves; wrap each with a piece of bacon. Secure the bacon with toothpicks to prevent unraveling while baking. Arrange wrapped jalapeno peppers onto a baking sheet with cream cheese side facing down.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.    
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, turn, and continue cooking until the bacon is completely browned, about 10 minutes more.    
Transfer jalapeno wraps to preheated grill; cook until the bacon is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
