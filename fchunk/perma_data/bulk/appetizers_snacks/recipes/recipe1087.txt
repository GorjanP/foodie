Cut the top off each cherry tomato, and scoop out the pulp. Place the tomatoes upside down on paper towels to drain.    
In a food processor, mix the shrimp, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, horseradish, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.    
With a pastry bag, pipe the shrimp mixture into the cherry tomatoes. Garnish with parsley, and refrigerate until serving.
