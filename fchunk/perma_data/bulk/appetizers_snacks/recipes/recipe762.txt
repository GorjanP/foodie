In a large, heavy saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add chopped garlic, onions, and bell pepper; saute until soft.    
Add meat; cook and stir until browned.  Drain off excess fat.   Stir in tomato sauce and cilantro.  Simmer until cilantro wilts.  Remove from heat, and cool until mixture can be handled.    
Wrap 2 to 3 tablespoons of meat in an egg roll wrapper to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining ingredients.    
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or deep fry pan to 360 degrees F (168 degrees C). Fry patties in hot oil until golden brown.  When done, transfer to plates lined with paper towels to drain.
