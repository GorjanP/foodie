Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Gently blend beef, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, onion, garlic, salt and pepper until evenly combined. Form into about 40 bite-sized meatballs.    
Place meatballs on a foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet; bake for 20 minutes or until cooked all the way through.    
Combine chili sauce and jelly in a saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until jelly dissolves, about 5 minutes.    
Add cooked meatballs to the sauce; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Makes 8 servings.
