Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place hot dogs in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Drain.    
Roll crescent dough onto a work surface; tear into 8 pieces. Roll 1 piece dough around each hot dog, creating the look of a mummy. Place dots of mustard on the top of each for the eyes, nose, and mouth. Arrange hot dogs on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crescent dough is golden brown and flaky, about 10 minutes.
