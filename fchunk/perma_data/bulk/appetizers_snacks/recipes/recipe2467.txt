In a small bowl, mix together the cream cheese, pickles, mustard, and chives.    
Spoon 1/5 of the mixture onto each ham slice, then roll ham slices up carefully. Wrap each roll in aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 2 hours minimum.    
When you are ready to serve, unwrap the ham 'roulettes', and slice. Serve chilled.
