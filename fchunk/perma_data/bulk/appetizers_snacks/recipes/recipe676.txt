Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, soy sauce, imitation crabmeat, water chestnuts and green onions.    
Place approximately 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper. Fold into triangles and seal edges with moistened fingers.    
In small batches, fry the wontons in the hot oil 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
