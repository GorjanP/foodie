Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil; add jalapeno peppers. Reduce heat to medium and boil peppers for 15 minutes; drain. When cool enough to handle, remove stems of peppers.    
Place jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, garlic salt, cumin, black pepper, white pepper, and cilantro in a blender. Blend to your desired texture, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
