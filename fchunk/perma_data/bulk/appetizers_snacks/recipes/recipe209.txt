Preheat the broiler.    
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl.    
Blend cream cheese with the sausage. Stuff mushroom caps with the cream cheese and sausage mixture.    
Arrange stuffed mushroom caps on a medium baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly browned.
