Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.    
Pour melted butter into a small bowl. Dip each piece of biscuit dough in melted butter to coat.    
Arrange enough of the biscuit dough pieces in the bottom of the loaf pan to form a single layer; top with 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup pepper slices, and 1/4 teaspoon parsley. Repeat layering once and top with remaining biscuit dough pieces, pepper slices, and parsley flakes.    
Mix remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese together in a bowl; spread over the top of the ingredients to cover.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool bread in pan for 5 minutes before inverting onto a plate to serve.
