Pour the cheese sauce into a large slow cooker. Cover, and set to High.    
Place a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the ground beef until completely browned; stir in the taco seasoning. Reserving the fat in the skillet, use a slotted spoon to transfer the beef to the slow cooker and stir into the cheese.    
Return the skillet to medium heat. Combine the onion and chili powder in the skillet; cook until the onion softens. Stir in the tomatoes with green chiles. Add to the cheese mixture and stir through. If sauce is too thick, stir in up to 1/2 cup water.
