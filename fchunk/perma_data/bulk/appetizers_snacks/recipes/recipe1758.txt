Melt the butter with the olive oil in a shallow skillet over medium heat; cook the onion in the butter and oil until translucent. Season with salt, pepper, basil, paprika, tarragon, and brown sugar. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until the onions have softened and caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.    
Mix the goat cheese and sour cream together in a bowl; stir the onions into the mixture.
