Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Add chicken breasts and cook until juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board to cool completely. Use a fork to shred the meat into strands.    
Pour the ranch dressing, cream cheese, and wing sauce into a bowl and mix until combined. Add the shredded chicken and mix well. Spread the mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over top of the chicken mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling, about 10 minutes.
