Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cream cheese, hot sauce, ranch dressing, onion, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a bowl; fold in chicken.    
Roll crescent roll dough onto a work surface, pressing dough into a thin layer without tearing. Cut 3-inch pieces out of dough using a biscuit cutter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture into the center of each dough piece. Pull dough over filling and press into other edge of dough; crimp edges together using a fork.    
Arrange pockets on a baking sheet. Brush each pocket with butter and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
