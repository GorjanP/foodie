Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch baking dish.    
Stir the cream cheese, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, seafood seasoning, Cajun seasoning, hot pepper sauce, and garlic powder in a mixing bowl until smooth. Stir in the crabmeat and bread crumbs until evenly blended. Spoon the cheese mixture into the mushroom caps; set them filling-side-up into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes; set the oven to broil and broil until the tops are crisp and brown, about 3 minutes.
