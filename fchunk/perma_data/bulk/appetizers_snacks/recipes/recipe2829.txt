Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a mini-muffin tin with cooking spray.    
Combine zucchini and carrot in a large bowl. Squeeze out excess water using a paper towel.    
Mix bread crumbs, feta cheese, basil, egg, salt, pepper, and oregano into zucchini-carrot mixture. Scoop mixture using a mini ice cream scoop or 2 spoons and press mixture into the prepared muffin tin using the back of a spoon.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
