Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Scoop out the seeds of each zucchini half with a spoon. Season the hollowed-out halves with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper.    
Mix together the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper in a bowl.  Divide cheese mixture between four zucchini halves. Arrange stuffed zucchini on greased baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until zucchini is tender and filling is beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
