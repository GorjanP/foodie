Place black beans in a medium size mixing bowl, partially mash beans -- beans should remain a little chunky.    
In a medium size frying pan, heat oil over a medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic and saute for 4 minutes.    
Mix beans, corn, tomato, picante sauce, cumin, and chili powder into the frying pan; cook for 5 minutes or until thickened. Remove the pan from the heat, mix in cheese, cilantro and lime juice; stir until cheese is melted.
