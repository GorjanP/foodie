Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix crabmeat, Italian-style bread crumbs, panko, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, egg, milk, and butter in a bowl until thick yet pliable enough to shape. Divide and roll into 12 1-inch balls.    
Gently press the balls into the mushroom caps and press to spread into a rounded mound atop the mushroom.    
Bake in preheated oven until heated through and golden on top, about 30 minutes.
