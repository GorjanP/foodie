Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Place garlic on a baking sheet, and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until soft. Set aside.    
Meanwhile, melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and apple in butter until tender and browned. Set aside.    
Arrange brie on top of thawed puff pastry. Top the cheese with the apple and onion mixture. Fold puff pastry over the cheese, and pinch closed. Brush with melted butter.    
Bake about 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve warm.  Garnish with whole cloves of roasted garlic.
