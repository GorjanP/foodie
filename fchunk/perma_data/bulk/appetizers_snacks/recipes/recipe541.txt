Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
In a large bowl, beat egg white until foamy. Stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and vanilla. Add nuts, and stir to coat. Spread evenly onto prepared pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until well toasted and golden brown.  Remove from oven, and cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
