Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Place pie crust dough onto a flat surface. Spread them generously with mustard. Spread 1/2 pound of sausage onto each pie crust. Flatten the sausage down with a spatula. Roll the pie crust mixture up like a jelly roll. Slice the roll into 1/2-inch circular pieces.    
Bake for 18 minutes or until sausage is cooked.
