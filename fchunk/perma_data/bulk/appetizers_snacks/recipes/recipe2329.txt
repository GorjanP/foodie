Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, bacon bits, chives, and hot sauce. In a separate bowl, mix the uncooked sausage and Cheddar cheese. On a flat surface, mix the seasoned coating mix, cumin, and chili powder.    
Cut a slit lengthwise into each jalapeno pepper, and remove the seeds. Stuff the peppers with the cream cheese mixture. Press the sausage mixture around the stuffed jalapenos, and roll in the seasoned coating mix to coat.    
Arrange the coated jalapenos on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the sausage is evenly brown.
