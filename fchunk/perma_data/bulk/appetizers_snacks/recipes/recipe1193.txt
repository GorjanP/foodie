In a medium bowl, use a mixer to smooth the cream cheese. Pour in the salsa 1 tablespoon at a time while continuing to mix. Continue adding salsa and mixing until the ingredients have attained a spreadable consistency.    
Spread the mixture on the flour tortillas. Roll the tortillas and slice them into bite-sized pieces. Refrigerate until serving.
