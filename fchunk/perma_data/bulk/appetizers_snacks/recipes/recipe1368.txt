Preheat your oven's broiler.    
Slice bread loaf into 1-inch thick portions.  Brush each slice on one side with olive oil.  Broil, oil-side up, until barely golden. Remove from broiler pan and cool.    
In a medium bowl, mix together roasted pepper, garlic, tomato, basil, and onion.  Sprinkle mixture evenly on each toast portion. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar.  Serve immediately.
