Stuff dates with chopped nuts: the nuts are inserted into the space left by the pit.    
Place dates in a small pan. Sprinkle with pepper if desired. Add wine, then drizzle honey over dates. Cook over medium heat until the skins begin to peel off the fruit. Transfer dates to a serving dish, and allow to cool slightly before serving.
