In a shallow bowl combine flour, egg, parsley, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper.  Gradually add beer, stirring, until a thick batter forms.  Add more or less beer depending on the desired consistency of the batter.    
In a heavy frying pan heat oil (adjust amount, depending on the size of your pan, so that you have a couple of inches of oil) over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, dip onions in batter and fry, turning once to brown evenly on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.
