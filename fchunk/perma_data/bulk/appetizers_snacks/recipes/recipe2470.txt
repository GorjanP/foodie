In a large stainless steel pot, place pig's feet and enough water to cover.   Boil feet 2 hours or until tender; drain.  Rinse feet in hot water to remove excess fat.  Remove as many bones as you can.    
Put 1 chili pepper and 3 pig's feet in each one quart jar.  In a separate bowl, mix salt and vinegar together.   Pour vinegar mixture over pig's feet to cover.  Seal jars and refrigerate for at least 3 days to 1 week before eating.
