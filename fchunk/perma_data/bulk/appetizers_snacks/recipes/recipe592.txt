Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.    
Unroll dough, separate at perforations, creating 4 rectangles. Press perforations to seal.    
With a knife or pizza cutter cut each rectangle lengthwise into 8 strips making a total of 32 strips. Wrap one strip of dough around each Lit'l Smokies(R) stretching dough slightly to look like bandages, leaving tip exposed to create face. Place on ungreased cookie sheet.    
Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Draw features on tip of Lit'l Smokies(R) to create face. Serve with mustard or ketchup, if desired.
