Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Combine cone-shaped corn snacks, cheese crackers, pretzels, corn cereal squares, mini shredded wheat squares, and pecan halves in a large bowl. Whisk butter, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl. Pour butter mixture over snack mixture and toss lightly to coat. Spread mixture into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until snacks are lightly toasted and liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour; stir every 15 minutes.
