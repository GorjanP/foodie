Place potato slices into a large bowl of cold water as you slice.  Drain, and rinse, then refill the bowl with water, and add the salt. Let the potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes. Drain, then rinse and drain again.    
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).  Fry potato slices in small batches. Once they start turning golden, remove and drain on paper towels. Continue until all of the slices are fried. Season with additional salt if desired.
