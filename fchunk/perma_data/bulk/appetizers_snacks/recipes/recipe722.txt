Cut a large hole in the top of the loaf of bread to form a bowl; set onto a serving platter.    
Melt the cream cheese in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in the Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, beer, and garlic salt; heat, stirring continually, until all the cheese is melted; pour the hot cheese mixture into the bread bowl.
