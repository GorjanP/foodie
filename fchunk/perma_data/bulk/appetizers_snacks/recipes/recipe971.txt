Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Drain the artichokes, squeeze the juice out of them,  pull them apart and place in a 1-quart casserole dish.    
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine Mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and mayonnaise. Pour this mixture into the casserole and mix well until the artichoke hearts are mixed in well. Sprinkle the parsley over the top.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until the dip is brown on top.
