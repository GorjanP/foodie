Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken chunks 5 minutes, until browned on all sides. Reduce heat to medium, and pour in the preserves and chili sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.    
Mix the pineapple chunks into the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking 2 minutes, until heated through. Serve with toothpicks.
