Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Place nuts on a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan, and bake for 10 minutes. Remove nuts, and melt butter on pan.    
In a medium bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the sugar and salt. Fold toasted nuts into egg white mixture. Arrange the coated nuts in a single layer on the buttered pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, turning nuts with spatula every 10 minutes, until outside is crisp and golden. Cool, and store in an airtight container.
