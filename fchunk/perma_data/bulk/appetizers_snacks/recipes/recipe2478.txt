Bring 4 quarts of water to boil in a large saucepan. Place the roma tomatoes in the boiling water for about 1 minute to loosen the skins. Drain, and rinse with cold water. Peel, core, seed, and coarsely chop.    
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Slowly cook and stir the tomatoes with salt and pepper for 15 minutes.    
Stir in the garlic and cook 5 minutes. Stir the arugula into the mixture, then remove skillet from heat. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.    
Gently fold the sun-dried tomatoes and Parmesan cheese into the mixture. Cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 4 hours before serving.
