Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Sprinkle chopped chile peppers in a well greased 9x9 inch square baking dish. Cover with cheese, then pour beaten eggs over all.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until firm. Remove from oven, and cool completely. Cut into 1/2x1 inch squares. Stick a toothpick into each square, and place on a large serving plate.
