In a bowl, mix together chevre and cream cheese with a fork. Add port wine and a pinch of salt and pepper; mix until smooth. Chill 30 minutes.    
Toast almonds stovetop in a dry frypan until toasted, shaking the pan frequently, about 5 minutes on medium high heat. Lay out on a large cutting board to cool. Using a chef's knife, finely chop the almonds. Alternately, if you prefer to have ground almonds, chop in a food processor or grinder.    
Scoop 1 tablespoon cheese mixture. Press grape into mixture. Using plastic wrap, cover grape with cheese and roll into little ball with grape inside. Remove plastic wrap. Continue making rest of truffles.    
Spread almonds onto plate and mix in the chives. Roll each truffle ball in almonds and coat evenly.    
Refrigerate, covered until serving.
