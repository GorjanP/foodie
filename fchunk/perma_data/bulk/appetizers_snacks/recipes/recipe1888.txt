Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until soft and translucent; transfer to a large bowl. Add ground chicken, baking mix, shredded cheese, garlic and red pepper flakes. Mix well, and form into 1 inch balls. Place on a non-stick baking pan.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until browned.
