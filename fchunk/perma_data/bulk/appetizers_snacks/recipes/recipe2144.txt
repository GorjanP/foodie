Preheat the broiler    
Cut bread into thirds. Spread each third with processed cheese sauce. Sprinkle with olives. Roll thirds jelly-roll fashion. Wrap each with half a strip of bacon, securing with toothpicks. Arrange wrapped bread rolls in a single layer on a large baking sheet.    
Broil, checking frequently,  until bacon is evenly browned and has reached desired crispness, about 5 minutes.
