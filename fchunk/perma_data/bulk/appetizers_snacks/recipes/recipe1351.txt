Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Whisk milk, egg, and onion together in a bowl. Stir pancake mix, cornmeal, and salt into milk mixture to form a smooth batter.    
Scoop ping pong ball-sized balls of batter using a small ice cream scoop; drop about 5 scoops per batch into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
