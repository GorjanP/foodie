Mix the cream cheese and pineapple in a bowl until evenly blended. Place the tortillas on a clean work surface. Spread 2/3 of each tortilla with the cream cheese mixture. Place a slice of ham over the cream cheese. Roll up each tortilla towards its uncovered edge. If needed, seal the edge with a dollop of cream cheese. Wrap each tortilla roll in plastic wrap, sealing tightly. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.  Unwrap, and cut into 1/2 inch wide pieces.
