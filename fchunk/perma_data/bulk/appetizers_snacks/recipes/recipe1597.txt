Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush one side of each slice of bread with melted butter, and place butter side up on a baking sheet. Bake for 7 minutes, or until lightly toasted.    
In a small bowl, stir together the blue cheese, softened butter, salt and pepper. Spread this mixture over the tops of the toasted bread slices, then sprinkle with chopped walnuts.    
Bake for 6 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the topping is melted and bubbly. Arrange on a serving tray and garnish with chopped parlsley.
