Place black-eyed peas in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 90 minutes, or until black-eyed peas are tender.    
Drain black-eyed peas. Cover with Italian-style salad dressing.    
In a large bowl, mix together jalapeno, onion, pimento peppers, garlic, green bell pepper, and ground black pepper. Toss in black-eyed pea mixture. Chill in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight before serving.
