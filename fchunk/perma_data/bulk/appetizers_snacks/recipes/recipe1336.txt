Preheat the broiler.    
Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Arrange jalapeno chile peppers on a medium baking sheet. Place in the broiler approximately 5 minutes, turning once, until lightly browned. Remove from heat and place in a small airtight container.    
In a medium bowl, whip together cream cheese, cilantro, garlic, salt and pepper. Place eggs in a small bowl. Place Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs in a small bowl.    
Remove jalapenos from container. Remove skins and stems. Cut off tops and remove seeds. Stuff each with equal amounts of the cream cheese mixture. Roll in the eggs, then coat with bread crumbs.    
In batches, deep fry stuffed, coated jalapenos in the prepared oil 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
