In a bowl, mash the avocados and mix in the lemon juice. In a separate bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, and taco seasoning.    
Spread the refried beans over the bottom of a large serving platter or bowl. Top with avocado mixture. Spread sour cream mixture over the avocado, and sprinkle with cheese. Layer cheese with green onions (just the green part), then tomatoes, and top with the olives. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator 2 to 4 hours before serving.
