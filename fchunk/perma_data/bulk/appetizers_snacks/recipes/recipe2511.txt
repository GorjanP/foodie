Combine the kale pieces, olive oil, lemon juice, and sea salt in a resealable bag. Seal and massage the mixture for 3 minutes. The kale will be starting to break down a bit. Drizzle the honey over the mixture and again massage gently for another 3 minutes; the kale will now be half the bulk you started with.    
Lay flat and even in a food dehydrator; cook at 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) until crispy, about 8 hours. Alternately, you can bake in an oven at 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) until crispy, 4 to 5 hours.
