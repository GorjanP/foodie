Using a bread knife, remove the 'crown' of the bread. Hollow out the inside of the loaf, and cut into bite size cubes for dipping.    
In a medium bowl, blend sour cream, mayonnaise, chipped beef, Beau Monde seasoning, celery salt, and dill weed. Mix thoroughly, cover, and chill for at least 1 hour.    
Spoon the chilled dip into the hollow bread loaf, and serve with cubed bread for dipping.
