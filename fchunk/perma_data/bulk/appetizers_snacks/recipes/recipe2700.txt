Stir flour, 2 teaspoons salt, paprika, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl.    
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Press calamari rings into the flour mixture until evenly coated, shaking off excess flour.    
Working in batches, fry calamari rings in the hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer cooked calamari to a paper towel-lined plate; sprinkle with salt. Serve calamari with cocktail and lemon wedges.
