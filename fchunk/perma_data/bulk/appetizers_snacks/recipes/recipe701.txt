Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
In a large bowl, mix zucchini, all-purpose baking mix, onion, salt, eggs, Cheddar cheese, vegetable oil and garlic.    
Spread zucchini mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 25 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned. Cut into bite-sized pieces to serve.
