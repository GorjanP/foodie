Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add jalapeno peppers, cover, and steam until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Mix cream cheese with Parmesan, Cheddar, and feta cheeses, garlic, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.    
Arrange jalapeno peppers on prepared baking sheet. Spoon cheese mixture into each pepper.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10 minutes.
