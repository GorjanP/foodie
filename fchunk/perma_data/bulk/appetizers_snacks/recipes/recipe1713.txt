Mix Cheddar cheese and flour together in a bowl. Stir in butter, cover, and refrigerate 1 hour, or more.    
Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Form chilled dough into small balls, pressing a deep hole in the center using your thumb. Stuff each ball with an olive, and seal completely.    
Bake in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown, watching carefully and turning as needed to prevent bottoms from burning.
