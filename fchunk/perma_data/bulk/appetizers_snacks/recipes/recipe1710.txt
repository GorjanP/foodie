Preheat the broiler.    
In a medium bowl, blend fat free cream cheese, nonfat sour cream and fat-free mayonnaise with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in 1/2 the reduced fat Swiss cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, green onions and garlic.    
Arrange bread slices in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Lightly toast under the broiler. Remove from heat.    
Spread French bread slices with the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle with remaining Swiss cheese. Broil under the preheated broiler approximately 1 1/2 minutes, until cheese is melted. Remove from heat and sprinkle with ground black pepper.
