Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine chicken, Cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, butter, and hot sauce in a bowl. Scoop about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture onto the center of each wonton wrapper; fold wontons in half and press to seal. Arrange wontons on a baking sheet and freeze for 5 to 10 minutes.    
Fry in preheated oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
