Place garbanzo beans, 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs, onion, 1/4 cup olive oil, egg, parsley, curry powder, garlic powder, lemon juice, and black pepper in a food processor or blender. Puree until coarse crumbles form. Blend more panko crumbs into mixture if it is too moist.    
Roll mixture into balls about the size of a golf ball; place on a plate.    
Press into patties and coat in panko bread crumbs.    
Heat about 1-inch olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.    
Pan-fry patties until crispy, about 3 minutes on each side.
