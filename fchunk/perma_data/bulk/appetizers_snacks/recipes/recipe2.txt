Bring chicken broth to a boil in a pot; add American cheese, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, until the cheese melts into the broth, about 5 minutes.    
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute chicken and chorizo in oil until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Add mushrooms, tomatoes, onion, jalapenos, green onions, and garlic; saute until all vegetables are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.    
Stir chicken mixture into the melted cheese; bring to a simmer. Stir Cheddar cheese into the mixture and cook until completely melted, about 5 minutes.
