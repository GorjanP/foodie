Place lean ground beef and onion in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Cook until beef is evenly brown and onion is soft. Drain and turn heat to medium low.    
Pour in condensed cream of mushroom soup. Mix in processed cheese food and desired amount of jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until all ingredients are well blended, about 10 minutes.    
Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.    
Reheat the mixture in a slow cooker, mixing in about 1 tablespoon of water to thin if necessary, before serving.
