Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together the garlic, spinach and ricotta cheese until well blended. Set aside. Place strips of prosciutto into mini muffin cups so that they line the bottom, but there is some meat hanging out over the sides, and it kind of looks like a flower. Fill each cup with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture, or so the cup is full and rounded on the top. The filling should look like the center of the flower.    
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the prosciutto is browned and stiff to the touch. The cups should be able to retain their shape after removing from the pan. Serve warm, but not hot.
