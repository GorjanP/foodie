Heat refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave on high until warmed through, about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute.    
Spray both sides of each corn tortilla with cooking spray and arrange them on a wire rack.    
Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry one side of each tortilla until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Return tortillas to wire rack, browned sides up.    
Spread a thin layer of refried beans onto the tortillas, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge.    
Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over refried beans.    
Carefully transfer a tortilla pizza back to the skillet, bean side up.    
Lightly fry until cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute more; return tortilla pizza to wire rack. Repeat with remaining pizzas.    
Scatter tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, and olives over melted cheese.    
Slice pizzas to serve.
