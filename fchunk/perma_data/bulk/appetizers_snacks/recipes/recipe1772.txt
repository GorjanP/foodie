Melt peanut butter and honey together in a saucepan over medium heat. Dissolve brown sugar into the peanut butter mixture; bring to a simmer for 2 minutes.    
Mix granola, oats, rice cereal, chocolate chips, and fruit together in a large bowl; pour peanut butter mixture over the granola mixture and fold to coat.    
Grease a cake pan. Pour the granola mixture into the prepared pan and press into a flat layer. Cool at room temperature until set, about 15 minutes before cutting into bars.
