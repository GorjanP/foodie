In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt butter and caramelize onions and mushrooms; add dates and warm mixture for about 2 minutes.    
Slice the Brie wheel in half down the center so that there is a top and a bottom; fill with the onion mixture. Replace the top of the Brie.    
Microwave Brie for 1 to 3 minutes or until bubbly; serve.
