Preheat your oven's broiler.
Crumble the sausage into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink; drain.    
Arrange the tortilla chips on a baking sheet. Top with sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, and banana peppers. Place nachos under the preheated broiler until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve with pizza sauce for dipping.
