Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Fill each jalapeno half with cream cheese. Wrap 1 bacon strip around each jalapeno half and secure with a toothpick. Arrange wrapped jalapenos on baking sheet.    
Bake 12 minutes in preheated oven, or until bacon strips are crisp. Serve warm.
