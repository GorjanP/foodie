Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).    
In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, mix together curry powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, maple syrup and golden currants. Bring to a boil and remove from heat.    
In a large bowl, toss together corn chips, crispy corn cereal squares, mini pretzels and popped popcorn. Pour in curry powder mixture and toss gently to attain an even coating.    
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until crisp and lightly browned.
