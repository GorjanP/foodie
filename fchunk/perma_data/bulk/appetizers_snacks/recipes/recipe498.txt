Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, bacon bits, pepper and onion.    
On a lightly floured surface, unroll the crescent rolls lengthwise and form into a long rectangle. Thinly spread the cream cheese mixture on the dough. Starting with the long edge of the rectangle, roll the dough into a long, thin roll. Slice the roll into 1/4 inch thick pieces.  Place rolls on a lightly greased baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until brown.
