Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Beat 1 egg in a medium bowl, and mix in the cheese. Season with  parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.    
On a lightly floured surface, cut each sheet of puff pastry into 6 equal squares to give 12 squares in total. Beat the remaining egg with water in small bowl. Brush edges of each square lightly with egg wash. Place a heaping tablespoon of the cheese mixture in the center of each square. Fold pastry over the filling, and seal edges with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, brush with remaining egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.    
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve immediately.
