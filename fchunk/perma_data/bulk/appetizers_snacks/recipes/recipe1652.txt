Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a small bowl, stir together the dill, garlic powder, oregano, paprika and olive oil. Brush onto one side of each tortilla. Use a pizza cutter, knife, or even scissors to cut the tortillas into wedges. Place the wedges on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.
