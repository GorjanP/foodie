Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Arrange the wonton wrappers on the baking sheet in a single layer. Brush each wrapper with egg white; sprinkle with oregano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Cut each into two triangles using a pizza cutter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 2 days.
