Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together vegetable oil, dry ranch dressing mix, garlic salt and cayenne pepper.    
Place pretzels in a medium baking dish. Coat with the vegetable oil mixture.    
Stirring occasionally, bake coated pretzels uncovered in the preheated oven 2 hours, or until toasted and crispy.
