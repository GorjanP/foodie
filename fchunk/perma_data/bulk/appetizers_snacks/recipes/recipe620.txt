Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1 quart baking dish.    
In a medium bowl, mix Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise and sweet onion. Transfer to the baking dish and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven 40 to 45 minutes, or until onions are tender and the mixture is bubbly and lightly browned.
