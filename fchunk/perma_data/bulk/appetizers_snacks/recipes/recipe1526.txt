Arrange bacon slices in a microwave save baking dish, side by side. Cover dish with a paper towel. Microwave on high until bacon is soft and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Chop bacon into small pieces; reserve 3 tablespoons bacon drippings.    
Combine the chopped bacon, reserved bacon drippings, cream cheese, tomato, green onions, and pesto in a large bowl; mix well. Evenly spread the cream cheese mixture on the tortillas; top each with a slice of turkey. Roll tortillas up tightly, and cut into 1/4 inch slices. Discard rounded ends.
