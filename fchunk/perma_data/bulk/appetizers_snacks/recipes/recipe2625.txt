Boil the garbanzo beans in water for about 30 minutes or until  tender when pierced with a fork; drain well.    
Beat the yogurt together with the following: fresh grated ginger, chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, rock salt or black salt, black pepper and salt.    
Season the mashed potato with salt.    
Break each puri gently with a fork to create a tiny opening on the top. Arrange the puris in 4 plates, 8 in each plate. Or, if using wheat crackers arrange them on a platter or plates. Place the potatoes on top of each cracker. Place about 1 tablespoon of potato in each puri or on each cracker. Place a few garbanzo beans on top of the potato. Spoon the spiced yogurt on top. Spoon green chutney  and sweet and sour chutney on top of it.  Garnish with the chopped onion, cilantro, and sev on top. Serving tip: I like to set up a number of small bowls with each of the above condiments, so that each person can add whatever they want to, according to their taste and preferences.
