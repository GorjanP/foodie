Heat oil in a heavy pot or deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until they just hold a stiff peak. Fold in Parmesan cheese until evenly distributed. Form level teaspoons of batter into balls.    
Fry balls a few at a time, turning once until crisp and golden. Using a slotted spoon, remove puffs from oil and place onto paper towels to drain.
