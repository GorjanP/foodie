In a bowl, mix the green olives, kalamata olives, Gorgonzola cheese, macadamia nuts, basil, tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic, and brown sugar. Season with salt and pepper.    
Lay each grape leaf flat, and place a heaped tablespoonful of the olive and Gorgonzola mixture in the center. Fold or roll the leaves around the mixture. Chill until serving.
