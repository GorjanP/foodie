Preheat oven to Broil/Grill.    
Sprinkle each 1/2 chicken liver with garlic salt to taste. Wrap 1/2 slice bacon around each chicken piece and fasten with a toothpick. Place on a broiling pan.    
Broil for 5 to 7 minutes. Turn pieces over and broil another 5 to 7 minutes, or until chicken livers are cooked through and no longer pink inside. Serve hot.
