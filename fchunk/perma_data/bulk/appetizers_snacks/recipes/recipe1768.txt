Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cream cheese, salami, olives, roasted red peppers, giardiniera, provolone cheese, and garlic together in a bowl; transfer to a 9-inch pie plate.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and hot, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle parsley over dip.
