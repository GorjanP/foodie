Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 9-inch pie plate with non-stick cooking spray.    
Slice each biscuit into quarters, arrange then in the prepared pie plate. Pour melted butter over the biscuits, then sprinkle the biscuits with blue cheese.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.
