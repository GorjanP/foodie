Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place ground beef and onions in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until onions are soft and ground beef is evenly brown. Remove from heat.    
Drain beef and mix in salsa, refried beans, green chile peppers and black olives. Transfer mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with cream cheese slices. Top with Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
