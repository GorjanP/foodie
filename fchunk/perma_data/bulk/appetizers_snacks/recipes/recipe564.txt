In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, egg, mayonnaise, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.    
In a large skillet, heat 1/4 inch of vegetable oil to a high heat. Roll heaping spoonfuls on the crab mixture in the crackers, then place the ball in the hot oil. Flatten lightly with a spatula so that the crab cake is 1/2 inch thick. Fry the crab cakes, flipping to ensure both sides get browned.
