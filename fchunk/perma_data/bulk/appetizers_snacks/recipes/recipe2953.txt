Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place pita breads on a baking sheet; brush each with olive oil. Sprinkle Gorgonzola cheese over each pita bread; top with pear slices and almonds.    
Bake in the preheated oven until pita bread is crisp and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes.    
Stir honey and balsamic vinegar together in a bowl until smooth; drizzle over pita pizzas. Cut pizzas into wedges.
