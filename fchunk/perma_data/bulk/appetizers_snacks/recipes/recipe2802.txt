Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix the creamy salad dressing, garlic, Parmesan cheese, green chile peppers and artichoke hearts.    
Transfer the mixture to a small baking dish. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly brown. Garnish with green onions and tomato.
