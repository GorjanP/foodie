Melt butter in a small saucepan; simmer garlic slices in hot butter over low heat until butter turns foamy, about 5 minutes.    
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Place bread loaf halves under the preheated broiler to toast, 2 to 4 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.    
Slice toasted bread into 2-inch thick slices. Dip toasted side of each slice into garlic butter.
