Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.    
Stir ground beef, refried beans, 3 cups Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream, cream cheese, and taco seasoning mix together in a bowl until well mixed. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; sprinkle with remaining 1 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.
