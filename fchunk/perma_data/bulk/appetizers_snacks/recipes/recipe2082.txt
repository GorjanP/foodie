Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until the mushrooms have softened and the onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Stir in the spinach, parsley, garlic salt, and pepper. Continue cooking until the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese. Cool for 5 minutes. Stir in the sour cream, then spread mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle 1 cup of Cheddar cheese on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes.
