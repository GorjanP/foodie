Preheat your oven's broiler.    
In a medium bowl, stir together mayonnaise, onion, cheddar, crabmeat, mustard, and garlic powder.    
Arrange bread slices on a cookie sheet. Place 1 tablespoon of the mixture on each slice. Sprinkle the bread slice liberally with lemon pepper spice (this is the key ingredient, so don't be shy with the spice!).    
Broil for less than two minutes.
