Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a shallow baking dish with aluminum foil and grease lightly.    
Cut tips from chicken wings and discard. Cut between the joint to separate each wing into 2 pieces.    
Combine butter and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat; heat until butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Mix Parmesan cheese, parsley, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.    
Dip chicken wing pieces in melted butter mixture; coat with Parmesan cheese mixture in the bowl. Arrange in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle any remaining butter on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until skin is browned and juices run clear, about 1 hour.
