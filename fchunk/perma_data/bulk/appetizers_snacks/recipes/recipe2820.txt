Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut each fig in half. (If you cannot find fresh figs and would like to use dried figs, cut a little opening in the top of the fig and make a pocket for the stuffing.)    
In a small mixing bowl, combine chocolate chips, almonds, and wine. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the stuffing mixture into each fig half.    
Bake on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes.
