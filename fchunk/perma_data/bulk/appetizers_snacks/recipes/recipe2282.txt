Place olives in a colander, and rinse in cool, running water. Rinse the olive jars out with water.    
In a large mixing bowl, combine bay leaves, rosemary, fennel, thyme, and white vinegar.  Add olives, and toss until olives are coated.  Place the mixture into the two jars; make sure each jar gets one bay leaf. Fill any empty space in the jars up with water. Cap jar, and shake well.  Refrigerate for at least 2 days.
