In a large, heavy sauce pan heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, crabmeat, garlic powder, paprika and water chestnuts.    
Place approximately 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the center of wonton wrappers. Moisten wrapper edges with water, fold over the mixture and pinch to seal.    
In small batches, fry the wontons 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown.
