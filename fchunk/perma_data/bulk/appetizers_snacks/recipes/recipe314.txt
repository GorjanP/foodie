In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, sour cream, fiesta-style ranch dressing mix, chunky salsa and Cheddar cheese. Spread even amounts of the mixture onto the tortillas. Roll tortillas and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.    
To serve, slice the chilled, rolled tortillas into 3/4 inch slices and arrange on a large serving platter.
