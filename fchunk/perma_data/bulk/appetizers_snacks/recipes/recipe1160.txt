Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, stir together, flour, sugar and salt. Add water, 1 egg white and melted butter; mix well to make a stiff dough. Knead until dough is smooth, about 5 minutes.    
Divide dough into 10 balls. Roll each ball on lightly floured surface until paper thin. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Brush with egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds.    
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until browned.
