Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, almonds, bacon, green onions, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Spread the mixture onto bread slices and arrange slices onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until the topping begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
