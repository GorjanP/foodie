Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Non-Stick Foil. Add the chicken wings to a large bowl, drizzle them with the vegetable oil then toss until the wings are thoroughly coated.    
In a small bowl, stir together the paprika, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, cayenne, turmeric, salt and pepper. Sprinkle the wings with the spice mixture, tossing until they are coated. Arrange the wings in a single layer on the baking sheet, spacing them apart so that they aren't touching.    
Bake the wings for 40 to 45 minutes until they are cooked through, then transfer them to a serving platter.    
In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, lemon juice, mint, cilantro, honey, salt and pepper. Taste and season the dip with additional salt and pepper as desired. Serve the wings with the yogurt dip.
