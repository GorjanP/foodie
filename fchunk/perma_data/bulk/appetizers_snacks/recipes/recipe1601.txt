Chop the raw tilapia into small pieces, and place in a large bowl. Pour in enough lime juice to cover the fish.    
Mix the tomato, red onion, and cucumbers into the bowl. Stir in the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.    
Allow the ceviche to marinate, refrigerated, for at least an hour. Taste for seasoning before serving; add salt and pepper if necessary.
