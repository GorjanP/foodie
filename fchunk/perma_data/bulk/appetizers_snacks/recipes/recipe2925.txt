Lightly mix the shrimp, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, and cilantro in a bowl, and pour in the Bloody Mary mix. Squeeze the limes over the mixture, add a dash of hot pepper sauce, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss again, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally.
