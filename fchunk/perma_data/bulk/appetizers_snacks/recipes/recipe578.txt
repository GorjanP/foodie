Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Make an indentation in the top of each uncooked biscuit. Fill indentations with oregano and a mozzarella cube. Pinch the dough around the mozzarella cubes.    
Place the biscuits, pinched side down, on a medium, ungreased baking sheet. Cover with pizza sauce.    
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
