Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium glass baking dish, spread the cream cheese. Pour in the salsa, spreading it evenly over cream cheese. Pour in and evenly spread chili with beans. Top with Cheddar cheese.    
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
