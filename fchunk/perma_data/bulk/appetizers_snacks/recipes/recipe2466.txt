Place ground beef in a large skillet.  Cook and stir over medium heat until browned.  Drain off excess fat. Stir in salsa, and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.    
Pat cooked meat into bottom of a pie plate, cover, and refrigerate.    
When meat is completely chilled, spread sour cream over meat. Arrange lettuce evenly over sour cream, and top with Cheddar cheese.
