Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Spread fries onto a baking sheet and coat with cooking spray.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, 35 to 40 minutes.    
Mix pizza sauce and oregano together in a bowl; pour over fries. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over sauce mixture and top with pepperoni slices. Sprinkle parsley over sauce and pepperoni.    
Turn the oven to broil.    
Broil fries until cheese is browned and bubbling, 2 to 4 minutes.
