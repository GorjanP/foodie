Toss chicken wings in a large bowl with apple cider vinegar, garlic salt, paprika, red pepper flakes, onion salt, and black pepper to coat; cover bowl with plastic wrap.    
Marinate chicken in refrigerator 1 to 4 hours.    
Scatter flour over the chicken wings; toss to coat. Discard any remaining marinade.    
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Heat shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry chicken in hot shortening until golden, 5 to 7 minutes per side.    
Arrange fried chicken pieces onto a baking sheet.    
Bake chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes; remove chicken to a platter lined with paper towels to drain.    
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic in melted butter until translucent, about 2 minutes.    
Stir hot sauce into the butter and garlic mixture; reduce heat to low and simmer sauce 5 minutes. Transfer sauce to a large bowl.    
Move drained chicken in batches to the bowl with the sauce and turn to coat. Drizzle any remaining sauce over wings to serve.
