Thoroughly mix kiwis, Golden Delicious apples, raspberries, strawberries, and fruit preserves in a large bowl. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Coat one side of each flour tortilla with butter-flavored cooking spray. Cut into wedges and arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle wedges with cinnamon sugar. Spray again with cooking spray.    
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown and crispy, about 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with any remaining tortilla wedges. Allow to cool approximately 15 minutes. Serve with chilled fruit mixture.
