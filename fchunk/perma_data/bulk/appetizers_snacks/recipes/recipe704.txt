Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, blend Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, ranch-style dressing mix, black olives and green onions. Increase the amount of mayonnaise as desired if the mixture seems too dry.    
Spread equal amounts of the Cheddar cheese mixture on French baguette slices. Arrange slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned. Serve warm.
