Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with olive oil cooking spray.    
Stir quinoa, spinach, bread crumbs, eggs, and Colby cheese together in a bowl. Drop spoonfuls of the quinoa mixture onto the prepared baking sheets and press to desired thickness.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms of the patties are golden, about 15 minutes. Flip patties and bake until golden, about 5 minutes more.
