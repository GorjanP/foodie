Preheat oven or toaster oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Place mushroom caps, gill side up, on baking sheet.  Drizzle with soy sauce and add a few grinds of black pepper to each cap.    
Bake for 25 minutes.  Remove from oven, and sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoon blue cheese onto each cap.  Return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is fully melted.
