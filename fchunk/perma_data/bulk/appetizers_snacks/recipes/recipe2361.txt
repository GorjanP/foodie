Stir soy sauce, lemon juice, peanut butter, garlic, curry powder, brown sugar, and hot pepper sauce together in a large bowl until marinade is well-combined. Place chicken in the marinade and stir to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.    
Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade and thread chicken onto skewers.    
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until juices run clear and chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.
