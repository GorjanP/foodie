Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Stir the minced mushroom stems together with garlic, parsley, cheese, and butter. Stuff the mushroom caps with this mixture, and coat the stuffing-side thickly with bread crumbs. Place the mushroom caps stuffing-side-up onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until the bread crumbs have turned golden brown, and the stuffing is bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the Alfredo sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. Serve the baked mushrooms drizzled with Alfredo sauce.
