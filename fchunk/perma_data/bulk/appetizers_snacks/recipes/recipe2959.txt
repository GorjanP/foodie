Split each snow pea down one seam.    
Mix cream cheese, smoked salmon, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Spoon salmon mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe mixture into the center of each snow pea pod, creating a scalloped edge. Sprinkle dill weed over cream cheese filling.
