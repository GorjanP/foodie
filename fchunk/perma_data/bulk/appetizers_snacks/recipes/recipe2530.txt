Combine popcorn kernels and oil in a deep pot over high heat and place a cover on the pot. Cook the popcorn, frequently shaking the pot to move the kernels, until the sound of kernels popping slows to nearly a stop, about 7 minutes. Carefully pour popcorn into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle lime zest and salt over the popcorn.    
Whisk lime juice, melted butter, and sriracha sauce together in a bowl; drizzle over popcorn and toss to coat.
