Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add eggplant, basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper to onion mixture; cook and stir, mashing occasionally with a wooden spoon, until eggplant is cooked through but still holds shape, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool mixture to room temperature.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat (such as Silpat(R)).    
Mix Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs into eggplant mixture; shape into 15 to 18 "meatballs". Arrange "meatballs" on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 30 minutes.
