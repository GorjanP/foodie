Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
In a blender or food processor, place artichoke hearts, Romano cheese, Parmesan cheese and garlic . Pulse until chopped, but not ground. Set aside.    
In a medium bowl, mix together spinach, heavy cream, sour cream and mozzarella cheese. Stir in artichoke mixture. Spoon into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
