Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place spicy pork sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown.    
Drain sausage and place in a large bowl. Mix in 4 green onions, nonfat sour cream, low-fat mayonnaise, fat-free Parmesan cheese and pimento peppers.  Transfer sausage mixture to a medium baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned. Garnish with remaining green onion and serve hot.
