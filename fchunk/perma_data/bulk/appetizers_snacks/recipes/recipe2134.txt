Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Mix together the egg and milk in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the panko crumbs, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.    
Cut jalapenos in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Stuff each jalapeno half with equal portions of the blue cheese. Place the halves back together and secure with toothpicks. Dip each stuffed jalapeno in the egg mixture and then coat with the panko mixture. Arrange the breaded peppers on a baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
