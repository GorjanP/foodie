Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Whisk sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add apple slices and toss to coat. Arrange apple slices in a single layer on prepared baking sheets.    
Bake apples in the preheated oven until browned and just crisped, about 2 hours. Cool completely.
