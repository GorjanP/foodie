Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).    
Stir pumpkin seeds, whiskey, bacon drippings, brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the seeds begin to turn gray in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes; drain.    
Spread the drained seeds onto a baking sheet in a single layer; season with salt.    
Roast the pumpkin seeds in preheated oven until crisp and golden brown, 60 to 90 minutes.
