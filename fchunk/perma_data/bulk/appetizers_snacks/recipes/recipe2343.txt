Place peanuts, salt, pickles with brine, jalapenos, and crab boil in a large pot. Pour in water to cover the peanuts; stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until soft, at least 4 hours, adding water as needed to keep peanuts covered. Scoop peanuts out of the pot with a slotted spoon and serve hot.
