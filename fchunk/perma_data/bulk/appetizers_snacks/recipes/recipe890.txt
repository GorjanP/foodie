Place a steamer insert into a pot and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to just below a boil. Add eggs to steamer insert and steam for 15 minutes.    
Immediately transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water until cool enough to handle. Make a small crack on the large end of each egg and place eggs back into the ice water for about 20 minutes. Peel.
