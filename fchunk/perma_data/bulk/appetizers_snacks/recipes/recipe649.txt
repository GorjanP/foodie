Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Grease a cookie sheet and spread the seeds out in an even layer. Lightly sprinkle with salt and cinnamon.    
Bake for about 5 minutes, then stir the seeds. Season with salt and cinnamon again. Continue baking, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until seeds are toasted.
