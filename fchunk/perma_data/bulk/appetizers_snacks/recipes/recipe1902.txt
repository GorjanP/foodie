Wrap each scallop with a thin slice of prosciutto and secure with a toothpick.    
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the scallops into the pan, and cook for about 2 minutes on each side. Season each side with pepper as it is cooking. Once each side has been fried, sprinkle the white wine over the scallops, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.    
Remove the scallops from the pan to drain on paper towels. When slightly cooled, transfer to a serving tray, and remove the toothpicks to serve.
