Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spread oats, coconut, and almonds onto a baking sheet; toast in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.    
Mix toasted oats mixture with flour, raisins, brown sugar, wheat germ, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl; add eggs, canola oil, honey, and vanilla extract and mix into a sticky mixture.    
Generously grease a baking sheet. Spread the mixture into the baking sheet in an even layer, reaching completely to the edges.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes; carefully cut into bars immediately upon removal from oven.    
Let bars cool completely until hard before removing from sheet, at least 30 minutes.
