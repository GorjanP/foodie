Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a glass loaf pan with cooking spray.    
Mix cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, and seafood seasoning together in a bowl. Gently fold crabmeat into cheese mixture; pour into the prepared loaf pan and top with Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until dip is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Toast baguette slices on oven rack during the last 5 minutes of baking the dip.
