Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Combine the kiwi, mango, and banana in a bowl. Process the strawberries in a blender until they are liquefied and pour over fruit mixture.  Stir to coat and refrigerate.    
Coat both sides of each tortilla with the cooking spray.  Cut them into triangle-shaped wedges and place on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over the chips.  Bake in preheated oven until golden-brown, about 10 minutes.  Allow to cool and serve with the fruit mixture.
