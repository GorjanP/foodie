Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Spread 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce on tortilla.    
Mix 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce and chicken in a bowl until coated. Spread chicken mixture, half the red onion, and half the cilantro onto the tortilla. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over chicken mixture. Top with remaining red onion and cilantro. Place pizza on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tortilla is crisp and cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes.
