Place roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, oregano, and white pepper into a blender; puree until smooth. Add feta and cream cheese, and puree until smooth.    
With blender running, slowly pour in olive oil until incorporated and thickened. Stir in half-and-half if needed to achieve a dip consistency. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
