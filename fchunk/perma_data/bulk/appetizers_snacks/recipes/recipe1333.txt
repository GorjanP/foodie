Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Roll out pizza dough, and place on a baking sheet. Mix mayonnaise, Parmesan, basil, and garlic in a small bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture on pizza crust; top with sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.    
Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut into squares to serve.
