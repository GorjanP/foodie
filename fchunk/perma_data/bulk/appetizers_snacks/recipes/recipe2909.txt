Gently pound the beef with the smooth side of a meat mallet until about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer beef to a plate, maintaining the heart shape, and refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining slices to form a second heart.

Combine arugula, 1 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings, and capers in a bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice mixture over arugula mixture and toss to coat.    
Place half of the arugula mixture on top of beef. Drizzle lemon juice mixture over arugula and beef; season with salt and black pepper to taste and top with Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings. Repeat with remaining heart.
