Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, cheese spread, butter or margarine, mayonnaise, garlic salt, and parsley. Mix well, and spread on English muffins. Cut the muffins into quarters and arrange them on a cookie sheet.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Broil the muffins for the last minute to get them toasted.
