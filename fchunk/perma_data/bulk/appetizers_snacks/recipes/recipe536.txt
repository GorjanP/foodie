Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove and chop mushroom stems.    
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine ground beef, onion, and garlic. Cook until beef is no longer pink; drain. Mix in chopped mushroom stems, 1 tablespoon butter, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in cream.    
Dip mushroom caps in 1/4 cup melted butter, and stuff generously with meat mixture.  Arrange stuffed mushrooms in a baking dish. Sprinkle with chili powder.    
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven.
