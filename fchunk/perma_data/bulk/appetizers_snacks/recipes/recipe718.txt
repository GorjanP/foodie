Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together the shredded corned beef, cabbage, potatoes, carrot, and onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Lay the egg roll wrappers out on a clean dry surface a few at a time. Place about 1/2 cup of the mixture into the center of each wrap. Roll up into logs according to the directions on the package. Wet the edge with water to seal.    
Fry rolls a few at a time, turning if necessary, for about 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels.
