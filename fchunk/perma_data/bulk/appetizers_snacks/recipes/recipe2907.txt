Place figs on a flame-proof surface or plate and sprinkle flesh-sides with Demerara sugar. Using a kitchen torch set to a medium-high flame, melt the sugar by making short, even passes over the top of the sugar. Continue melting the sugar until it bubbles and turns dark brown, about 30 seconds.    
Place Burrata cheese on a plate. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Place bruleed figs around cheese and serve.
