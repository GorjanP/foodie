Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Drain sun-dried tomatoes, reserving 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Finely chop the sun-dried tomatoes.    
In a small bowl, combine, sun-dried tomatoes, reserved oil, garlic, and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.    
Lay roll dough out flat, and seal perforations. Spread tomato and cheese mixture evenly over the dough. Starting at one long end, roll the dough up to the middle. Roll up other long end to meet in the middle. Cut into 1/2 inch slices. Arrange on a greased cookie sheet, and brush with egg yolk mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn over, and continue baking for 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.  Serve warm.
