Sift the split pea flour, self-rising flour, and baking powder into a large bowl. Stir in turmeric, cumin, and salt. Gradually stir in enough water to make a very thick batter. Stir in onion, garlic, and green onion.    
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, drop tablespoonfuls of the batter into the pan, and fry until golden brown on both sides. Remove to paper towels to drain.
