Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Arrange the mushroom caps on a baking sheet with the cavity-side facing upwards. Drizzle the olive oil over the mushroom caps. Mix the sausage, blue cheese, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Fill the mushroom caps with the sausage mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the sausage is no longer pink, about 60 minutes.
