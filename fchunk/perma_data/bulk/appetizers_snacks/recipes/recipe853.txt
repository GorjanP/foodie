Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Stir olive oil and lemon pepper together in a bowl.    
Fry the chicken wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).    
Toss hot wings with olive oil mixture to coat.
