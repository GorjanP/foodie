Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 40 mini muffin cups with olive oil.    
Press 1 wonton wrapper into each prepared muffin cup, pressing wonton against the bottom and sides of the cup.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crisped and corners are browned, about 4 minutes. Cool.    
Stir bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, and honey mustard together in a bowl until well-combined. Fill each wonton with bacon mixture and top each with green onion.
