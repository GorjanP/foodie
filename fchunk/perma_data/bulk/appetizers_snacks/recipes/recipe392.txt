Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together the sausage, cream cheese, garlic salt, Romano cheese, oregano, basil, bread crumbs and olive oil.    
Stuff the peppers with the sausage mixture. Place on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes, until the stuffing is lightly brown and bubbly.
