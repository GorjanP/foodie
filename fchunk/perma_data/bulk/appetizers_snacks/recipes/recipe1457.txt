In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook until softened. Stir in ham, corned beef and garlic.  Cook mixture, stirring constantly for 1 minute.  Stir in 6 tablespoons flour and cook mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes.    
Stir in sauerkraut, parsley, and broth; cook for 3 minutes or until thickened and paste-like.  Spread mixture on a platter and chill for at least 3 hours.    
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, whisk together the egg, milk and 2 1/2 cups flour.  Shape the sauerkraut mixture by level teaspoons in to balls, dip them into the egg mixture and roll them in the bread crumbs.    
Fry balls in batches for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.  Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve warm.
