Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Melt butter in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.    
Mix cracker crumbs, ground beef, egg, nutmeg, and allspice with the onion until blended. Shape into 1 1/2 inch (4 centimeter) meatballs, and place in a glass baking dish. Sprinkle with minced garlic, and cover with foil.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.    
Meanwhile, make white sauce, following the directions on the packet. Stir in dill, sage, flour, and whipping cream.    
Turn off oven, and remove foil cover from meatballs. Pour sauce over meatballs, and leave in hot oven for 10 minutes.
