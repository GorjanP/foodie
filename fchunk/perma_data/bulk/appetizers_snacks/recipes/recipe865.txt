Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Combine tomato, basil, and red onion in a small mixing bowl; stir well. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.    
Arrange bread on a baking sheet. Place in oven, and bake until well toasted, approximately 5 minutes.    
Remove bread from oven, and transfer to a large serving platter. Let bread cool 3 to 5 minutes. Rub garlic into the top of each slice of toast; the toast should glisten with the garlic. Spoon the tomato mixture generously onto each slice, and serve.
