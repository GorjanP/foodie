Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan, and stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.    
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in onion, cover tightly, and cook until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes.    
In a large bowl, mix tuna, milk, flour, parsley, sugar, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in rice, onion, and eggs. Mold the mixture into 12 balls using 2 teaspoons.    
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet or deep fryer. Fry the tuna balls in batches until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
