Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, slowly cook and stir the mushrooms, parsley and onion in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Drain and set aside.    
Separate the dough into 4 rectangles. Cut rectangles in half, forming 8 squares, and arrange on a large baking sheet. Place 1 tablespoon mushroom mixture on each square. Top each square with 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese. Fold the squares into triangles.    
In a small saucepan, melt remaining butter. Brush triangles with butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.    
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm.
