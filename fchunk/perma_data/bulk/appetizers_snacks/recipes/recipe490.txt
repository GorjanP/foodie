Process cauliflower in a food processor finely minced; transfer to a large bowl.    
Stir flour, eggs, baking powder, and Italian dressing mix into cauliflower.    
Heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a frying pan over medium heat.    
Drop heaping tablespoons of cauliflower mixture into the hot oil; fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
