Heat 1 quart oil in a wok over medium high heat.    
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cabbage, carrots, cucumber, onion, green onion, shiitake mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, salt and pepper. Slowly cook and stir until all vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.    
Stir chicken, crabmeat and Chinese five-spice powder into the cabbage mixture. Sprinkle avocado with lemon juice, then stir it into the mixture. Remove from heat.    
Place approximately 1 teaspoon of the cabbage and chicken mixture in the center of spring roll wrappers. Fold wrappers, and seal the edges with moistened fingers.    
Carefully lower spring rolls into the heated quart of oil. Deep fry approximately 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Cut in half to serve.
