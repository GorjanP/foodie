Preheat oven to 370 degrees F (187 degrees C).    
Mix sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and garlic in a small bowl.    
Trim the top part of the rind from the Brie round and discard. Place Brie round in a round baking dish with the trimmed side facing up; top with the tomato mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is softened, about 20 minutes.
