In a large bowl, mix together the honey, lime juice, lime peel, garlic, salt and ground black pepper.    
Place the flour in a plastic bag and shake the chicken wings in the flour to coat.    
In a large skillet, fry the chicken wings in hot, 1 inch deep oil until cooked through. Place the cooked wings in the honey/lime mixture and toss to coat well. Serve immediately.
