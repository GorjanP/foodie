Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spread the butter over the top of the brie and top with the almonds. Place the brie in a baking pan and bake until the top puffs up, about 25 minutes. You may need to place a square of foil over the top after 15 minutes to prevent the almonds from burning.    
Combine the balsamic vinegar and molasses. Drizzle the mixture on a serving plate and carefully place the baked brie on top of the balsamic mixture.
