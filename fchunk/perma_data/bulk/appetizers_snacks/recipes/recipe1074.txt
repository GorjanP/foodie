In a medium bowl, marinate the water chestnuts in the soy sauce 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut the bacon slices in half. Wrap each water chestnut with 1 half slice of bacon. Secure with toothpicks and arrange on a large baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until the bacon is lightly crisp and evenly brown.
