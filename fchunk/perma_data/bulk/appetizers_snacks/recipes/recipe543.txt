Preheat  oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.    
Remove the stems and ribs from the kale, and shred the kale very thinly. Spread the shredded kale onto the baking sheets, and sprinkle evenly with Cheddar cheese.    
Bake the kale for 10 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning, until the kale is crisp and the cheese is browned.
