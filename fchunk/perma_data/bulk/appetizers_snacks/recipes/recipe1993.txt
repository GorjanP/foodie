Beat cream cheese, sour cream, picante sauce, taco seasoning, and garlic powder together in a small bowl until smooth. Stir olives, chilies, and Cheddar cheese into the cream cheese mixture.    
Spread about 1/2 cup of cream cheese mixture onto each tortilla. Roll each tortilla like a jelly roll; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours to overnight. Cut into 1-inch slices.
