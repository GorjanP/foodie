Preheat the broiler.    
In a medium bowl, mix marinated artichoke hearts, Romano cheese, red onion and mayonnaise. Top French baguette slices with equal amounts of the artichoke heart mixture. Arrange slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet.    
Broil in the preheated oven 2 minutes, or until toppings are bubbly and lightly browned.
