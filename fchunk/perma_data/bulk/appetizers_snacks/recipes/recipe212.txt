Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Rinse the pumpkin seeds and pat dry. Place them in a bowl. Add the Worcestershire sauce, melted butter and seasoned salt; stir until evenly coated. Spread out in an even layer on a baking sheet.    
Bake for about 1 hour in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until crisp, dry and golden brown.
