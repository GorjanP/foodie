Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of shredded cheese into the center of each wonton skin.  Fold the top and bottom corners in toward each other and roll it up like a little egg roll.  You will have to seal the wonton with a little water where the ends meet.    
Heat oil in a deep pot to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Fry the wontons two or three at a time.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve immediately.
