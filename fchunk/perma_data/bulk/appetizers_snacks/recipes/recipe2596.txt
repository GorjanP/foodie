Prepare risotto according to package directions. Chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour, until cooled.    
Roll risotto into 2 inch mounds. Place a marble-sized chunk of goat cheese on each mound. Press cheese chunks into mounds, then roll mounds around cheese, creating balls.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil and cook the risotto balls, turning occasionally, until evenly golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
