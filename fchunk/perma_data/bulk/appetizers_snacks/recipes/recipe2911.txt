Bring water, vinegar, sugar, hot pepper sauce, and crushed red pepper flakes to a boil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.    
Whisk yellow mustard and ketchup into the sauce.    
Stir in the orange. Bring sauce back to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, 2 to 4 hours.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Arrange the chicken wings in a large baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the wings are browned and no longer pink inside, 30 to 45 minutes.    
Stir the baked wings into the sauce to serve.
