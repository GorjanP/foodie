Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Combine chicken and Buffalo wing sauce in a bowl.    
Place 1 layer tortilla chips in the bottom of a baking dish; top with a layer of Buffalo chicken mixture, black beans, and Cheddar cheese. Continue layering with remaining tortilla chips, Buffalo chicken mixture, black beans, and Cheddar cheese.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the nachos with aluminum foil if the top is getting too dark.    
Top nachos with sour cream, blue cheese, jalapeno peppers, and green onion.
