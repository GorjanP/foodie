In a double boiler, melt cream cheese with mayonnaise. Stir in white wine. Mix in crab meat, mustard, seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Heat until entire mixture in warm, stirring occasionally. Thin the mixture with more white wine if you would like your dip's consistency to be thinner.
