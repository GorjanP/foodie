Preheat an outdoor or indoor grill to a high heat. Lightly grease the grill.    
Season wings with garlic powder and ground black pepper. Cook wings on the preheated grill until they are very crispy. Turn the wings frequently as they will burn easily.    
While the wings are grilling, in a large bowl, combine both hot sauces with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese and melted butter.    
When the wings are finished cooking, place them in the large bowl of hot sauce mixture and stir until they are coated.
