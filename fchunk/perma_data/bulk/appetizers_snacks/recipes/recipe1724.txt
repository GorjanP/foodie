Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place small amount of shredded chicken lengthwise along each won ton wrapper; roll up and seal by dampening edge of wrapper with a finger dipped in water. When you run out of chicken meat, place rolled won tons in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until wrapper is crisp.    
NOTE: These can also be frozen in a single layer, then placed in a storage bag and baked or deep fried as needed.
