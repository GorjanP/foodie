Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower and cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and break cauliflower into small pieces. Combine cauliflower, bacon, and green onions together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.    
Sift flour into a bowl. Whisk milk, egg, Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt into the flour until smooth. Add milk mixture to cauliflower mixture and stir until batter is evenly combined.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
