Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Line each cup a mini-muffin pan with a wonton wrapper, carefully pressing each into the shape of a cup. Take care to not tear the wrapper as they will tear easily.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer 'cups' to a baking sheet; repeat until remaining wontons are all baked.    
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Set sausage aside to cool.    
Stir cooled sausage, Colby cheese, green onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and ranch salad dressing together in a bowl; spoon into the wonton cups.    
Bake in oven until cheese has melted and is beginning to bubble, 15 to 20 minutes.
