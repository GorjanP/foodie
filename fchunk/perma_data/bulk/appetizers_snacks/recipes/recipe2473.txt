Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Place chicken in two 9x13 inch baking dishes. Blend garlic and mint leaves and spread mixture under skin of chicken pieces.    
In a small saucepan, heat butter, lemon juice and honey over medium low heat; mix well. Brush warmed mixture all over chicken skin.    
Bake for 1 hour, or until golden brown and cooked through (juices run clear). Brush again with honey mixture, and serve.
