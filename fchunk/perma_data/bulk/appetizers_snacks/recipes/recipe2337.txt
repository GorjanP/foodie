Dampen asparagus lightly with water. Coat with flour; trying to avoid coating the tips.    
Dip asparagus in beaten egg.    
Roll and coat asparagus in a layer of breadcrumbs.    
Place coated asparagus on a plate and refrigerate, allowing coating to stick, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Stir mayonnaise, green chilies, and hot pepper sauce together in a small bowl for dipping sauce.    
Heat vegetable oil in a fry pan over medium heat.    
Fry coated asparagus in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
