Preheat oven to broil.    
In a shallow bowl, whisk together the olive oil and vinegar.  Marinate the tomatoes in the mixture, stirring occasionally.    
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, parsley, oregano, black pepper and 4 teaspoons Parmesan cheese.  Spread mixture on each slice of toasted bread.  Place marinated tomatoes on 2 slices and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.    
Place on a baking sheet and broil for 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden brown.  Serve immediately, open faced or closed.
