Place water, salt, bread flour, dry milk, sugar, and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer.  Select Dough cycle.    
After cycle ends, roll out dough on a lightly floured surface; shape into a 16 x 10 inch rectangle.  Transfer to a lightly greased cookie sheet. In a small bowl, mix together chopped pepperoni and mozzarella. Spoon pizza sauce in a stripe down the center of dough lengthwise; add sausage and cheese filling.  Make diagonal cuts 1 1/2  inches apart down each side, cutting within a 1/2 inch of the filling. Criss cross strips over filling, sealing with water.  Brush top with melted butter.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes.
