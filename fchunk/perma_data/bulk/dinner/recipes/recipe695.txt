Preheat a large heavy skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes.    
Coat salmon with olive oil. Place in skillet, and increase heat to high. Cook for 3 minutes. Sprinkle with capers, and salt and pepper. Turn salmon over, and cook for 5 minutes, or until browned. Salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork.    
Transfer salmon to individual plates, and garnish with lemon slices.
