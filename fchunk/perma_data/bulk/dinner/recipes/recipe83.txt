Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.    
In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt.  Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.    
Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.
