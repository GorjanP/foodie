Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    
Combine all the ingredients together except for the Melt(R); stir well in a bowl.  Form around 30 balls out of the mixture.  Put them on a broiler pan coated with the melted Melt.  Bake around 15 minutes or until a cut meatball shows no pink inside.  Serve with pasta and sauce or place on a sandwich.
