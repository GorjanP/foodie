Place the ribs in a large stock pot with enough water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook over medium-high heat for 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In medium saucepan, combine ketchup, barbeque sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, steak sauce and garlic; blend well.  Cook the sauce over medium heat for approximately 20 minutes. (Please note that the above ingredients are all to taste.  Use more or less of anything you like.  I never make the ribs the same way twice!)    
Cut the ribs between the bones and place in a baking pan. Pour sauce over ribs, cover and cook for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes.
