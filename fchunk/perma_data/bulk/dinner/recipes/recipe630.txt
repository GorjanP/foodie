Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a shallow pan or baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Place fish fillets into the prepared pan.    
Heat margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix white wine, lemon juice, cilantro, garlic, salt, and black pepper into the melted margarine; simmer sauce for 2 minutes. Generously spoon sauce over fish fillets. Sprinkle fillets with paprika.    
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.
