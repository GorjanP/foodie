Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate.    
While the grill is preheating, mix together eggs, garlic, feta cheese, spinach, and turkey in a large bowl until well combined; form into 8 patties.    
Cook on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
