Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the ham in a roasting pan and dot with cloves. In a saucepan combine the pineapple juice, brown sugar, honey and orange juice. Stir and simmer over medium-low heat until thickened, about 10 minutes. Pour the glaze over the ham.    
Bake the ham uncovered for 1 hour in the preheated oven.
