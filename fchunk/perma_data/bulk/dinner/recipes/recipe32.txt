Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place the beef into a mixing bowl, and season with salt, onion, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, oregano, red pepper flakes, hot pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce; mix well. Add the milk, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs. Mix until evenly blended, then form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs, and place onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.
