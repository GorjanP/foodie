In a small bowl, mix together paprika, cayenne pepper,  white pepper, black pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and oregano.    
Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat for 10 minutes, or until extremely hot.    
Dip fish into melted butter, and sprinkle each fillet generously  with the seasoning mixture. Place the fish fillets in the hot skillet. Pour 1 tablespoon of butter over each fillet. Cook until the coating on the underside of the fillet turns black, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the fish over. Pour another tablespoon of butter over the fish, and cook for 2 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
