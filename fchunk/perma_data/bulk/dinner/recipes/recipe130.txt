Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pan.    
Combine milk and soft bread crumbs in a small bowl and allow to soften, about 5 minutes.    
In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, 3 tablespoons steak sauce, chopped onion, and green bell pepper. Add bread crumb mixture, and mix with your hands until all ingredients are combined.    
Pat the the mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Brush the top with additional steak sauce.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until done. Allow to stand 5 minutes before slicing.
