Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and black pepper to taste. Dredge the rump roast in the flour and cover evenly. Shake off excess.    
In a large pot over medium/high heat, melt the butter and brown the roast on all sides. Place in a 4 quart casserole dish with lid.    
In a small bowl, combine the soup mix, mushroom soup, and vermouth or white wine; pour over roast.    
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 3 hours or until desired doneness.
