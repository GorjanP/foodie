Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Stir together the maple syrup, mustard, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Place pork roast in a shallow roasting pan. Spread glaze evenly over pork roast.    
Roast pork in the preheated oven uncovered, until internal temperature measured with a meat thermometer reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour.  Remove from oven, and let rest about 10 minutes before slicing to serve.
