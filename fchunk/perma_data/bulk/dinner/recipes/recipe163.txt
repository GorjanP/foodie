Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place meat in a roasting pan. Sprinkle carrots, celery and minced garlic around roast.    
In a small bowl, combine the brown gravy mix and water, mixing into a smooth paste. Add onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup and cola-flavored carbonated beverage. Pour over the roast.    
Cover pan, and cook 1 hour in the preheated oven.    
Reduce oven temperature to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C), and continue cooking 2 hours. Remove from oven, and turn roast over so that the top is now covered with the gravy. Cover pan, and return to oven for a minimum of 2 hours.    
Remove from oven, and let meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
