Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.    
Season salmon fillets with salt.    
Place salmon on the preheated grill; cook salmon for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.    
Combine water, rice vinegar, brown sugar, chile paste, ginger, garlic, and soy sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat.    
Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer until barely thickened, about 2 minutes.    
Sprinkle basil on top of salmon; spoon glaze over basil.
