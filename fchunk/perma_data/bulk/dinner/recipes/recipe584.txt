Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add linguini and return water to a boil. Let linguini cook until al dente; drain well.    
In a large skillet, saute the onion and garlic in olive oil until the onions are translucent. Drain the cans of minced clams, reserving half of the juice.    
Stir the clams, reserved juice, butter, salt and pepper, and wine. Simmer the mixture for 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced 1/3 and has thickened.    
Spoon the clam sauce over the linguini and serve.
