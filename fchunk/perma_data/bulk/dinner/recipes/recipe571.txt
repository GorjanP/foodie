Dissolve bouillon in water.  Stir in the garlic, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.  Toss the meat in the marinade, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.    
Preheat a grill for high heat.    
Skewer the beef cubes, using 6 to 8 pieces per skewer.  Pour the oil onto a plate, and roll the skewers in it to coat them on all sides.    
Grill the skewers, turning frequently, until the beef has turned light pink, 12 to 15 minutes.
