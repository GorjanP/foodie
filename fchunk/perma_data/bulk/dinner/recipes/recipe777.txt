Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Lay each chop flat on cutting board, and with a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut a pocket into the pork, leaving three sides intact. Stuff each chop with spinach, and then with cheese.    
Place panko crumbs in a shallow dish. Coat each chop with a thin layer of horseradish, and then roll in crumbs. Arrange chops in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Creole seasoning to taste.    
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until brown and crispy.
