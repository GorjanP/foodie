Place the beef in a shallow dish.  Combine soy sauce, sugar, green onion, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and ground black pepper in a small bowl.  Pour over beef.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.    
Quickly grill beef on hot grill until slightly charred and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
