Preheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Place salmon on the baking sheet. Mix the melted butter and soy sauce in a small bowl, and brush over the salmon. Sprinkle salmon with lemon pepper.    
Broil salmon 6 to 8 minutes, depending on thickness, or until easily flaked with a fork.
