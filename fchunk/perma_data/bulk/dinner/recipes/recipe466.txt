Place chicken breasts in a dish with the Italian dressing. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.    
Preheat the grill for high heat.    
Stuff each jalapeno half with cream cheese. Roll chicken breasts around jalapeno peppers. Wrap each chicken breast with a slice of bacon. Secure with toothpicks.    
Lightly oil the grill grate. Arrange wrapped chicken breasts on the prepared grill. Cook for 20 minutes, turning frequently, or until bacon is browned and the chicken juices run clear.
