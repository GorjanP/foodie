In a glass baking dish, combine the garlic, white wine, lemon juice, soy sauce, olive oil, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Mix just to blend. Place swordfish steaks into the marinade, and refrigerate for 1 hour, turning frequently.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.    
Grill swordfish steaks for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Garnish with parsley and lemon wedges.
