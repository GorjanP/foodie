Preheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a baking pan.    
In a microwave safe bowl, mix the butter, garlic, soy sauce, pepper, and parsley. Cook 2 minutes on High in the microwave, or until butter is melted.    
Arrange chicken on the baking pan, and coat with the butter mixture, reserving some of the mixture for basting.    
Broil chicken 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until juices run clear, turning occasionally and basting with remaining butter mixture. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.
