Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.    
In a large skillet melt the butter and add the chopped garlic.  Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often, making sure not to burn the garlic.    
Pour about a 1/4 cup of the heavy cream into a small bowl.  Add the egg yolk and beat together; put aside.  Pour the remaining cream into the frying pan.  Increase the heat to medium-high.   As the cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk.  Slowly add the cream/egg mixture.  You do not want the egg to curdle.  Continue whisking until well blended.    
Add 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the cream.  Pour in the remaining Parmesan and the parsley, mix until smooth.  Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta.
