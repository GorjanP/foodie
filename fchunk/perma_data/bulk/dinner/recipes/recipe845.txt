Dissolve the bouillon cube in the hot water.  Combine uncooked vegetables, uncooked meats, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate, and bouillon.    
Roll out pastry dough into 6 x 8 inch rectangles.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of filling in the center of each rectangle.  Bring 6 inch sides together, and seal.  Cut a slit in the top of each pasty.  Place on dull, not black, baking pans.    
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
