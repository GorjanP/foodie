Pour about 1 inch of water in the bottom of a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the salt and place a steamer insert inside the pot so that it is just above the water level. Put the lobster tails on the rack and cover the pot. Cover and steam for 8 minutes. And don't peek! Serve with melted butter.
