In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, and lime juice. Season with chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Place the chicken in a shallow baking dish with the sauce, and stir to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.    
Preheat the grill for medium-high heat. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade.    
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill skewers for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear.
