Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the chicken into a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the condensed soup and sour cream. Pour over the chicken. In a separate bowl, stir together the crushed crackers, poppy seeds and melted butter. Sprinkle over the chicken and sauce.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top of the casserole is browned and the sauce is bubbly.
