Combine water, sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and lemon zest in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until just boiling, about 5 minutes.    
Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until reduced to a thick syrup, 10 to 15 minutes.    
Stir lemon juice into the syrup; bring to a boil and cook 1 to 2 minutes more; strain into a bowl and refrigerate until chilled.
