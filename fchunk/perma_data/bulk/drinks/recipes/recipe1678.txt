Pour schnapps into a shot glass.    
Very gently pour Irish cream liqueur over the schnapps. Wait until the Irish cream liqueur begins to clump and 'curdle' to look like a brain, just a few moments.    
Gently pour a tiny amount of grenadine 'blood' over the brain.    
Watch your guests gag over the look of one of the nastiest-looking Halloween drinks around. But they are yummy!
