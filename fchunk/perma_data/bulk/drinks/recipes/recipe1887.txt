Pour rice, cinnamon, and 3 cups water in a blender; blend until rice begins to break up, about 1 minute.    
Transfer rice mixture to a large bowl and stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups water; let stand for at least 3 hours, whisking occasionally.    
Strain rice mixture with a fine sieve into a large pitcher and discard rice.    
Stir coconut milk, sugar, and vanilla extract into the pitcher. Chill completely and stir before serving over ice.
