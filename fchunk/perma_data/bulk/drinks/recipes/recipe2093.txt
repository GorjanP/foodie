In a large measuring cup, combine the lemon juice and water. Add the Sweet'N Low, stirring until it dissolves.    
Spoon 1 tablespoon of liquid from the defrosted strawberries into a tall glass. Fill the glass with ice. Pour in the lemon juice mixture. If desired, garnish with the lemon slice and mint sprig. Enjoy the strawberries or save them for another use.
