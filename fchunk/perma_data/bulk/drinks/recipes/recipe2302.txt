Place 2 thin slices of cucumber in a bowl with basil leaves and sugar and smash with a fork until softened; pour in a teaspoon of watermelon vodka to loosen the mixture. Place crushed ice into a cocktail shaker and transfer cucumber-basil mixture into shaker; top with remaining watermelon vodka, lime juice, and simple syrup. Shake and strain into 2 chilled martini glasses; garnish each cocktail with 1 slice of peeled cucumber. Best enjoyed wearing flip-flops.
