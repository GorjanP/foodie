Pour sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of a martini glass with water and dip the moistened glass into sugar.    
Fill a shaker with ice. Pour in vanilla vodka, sour apple schnapps, and butterscotch schnapps. Cover the shaker and shake until chilled; strain cocktail into prepared martini glass. Garnish with maraschino cherry.
