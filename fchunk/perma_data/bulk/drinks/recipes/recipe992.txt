Pour chocolate syrup into chilled large glass.  Gently stir in milk.  Holding the carbonated water about 5 inches from the top of the glass, slowly pour into the glass until a thick foam comes to the top of the glass.    
Using a long swizzle stick, stir the mixture once quickly, make sure the foam does not bubble over the glass.  Serve immediately.
