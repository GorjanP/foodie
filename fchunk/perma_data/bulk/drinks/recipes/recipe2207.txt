Pour schnapps into a shot glass. Hold a teaspoon just above the schnapps, and slowly pour 151 rum onto the spoon, letting it run in a separate layer on top of schnapps.    
Hold the glass away from face, and light the rum with the flame of a match or lighter. Let it burn for 15 seconds. Blow out the flame, and drink it in one gulp.
