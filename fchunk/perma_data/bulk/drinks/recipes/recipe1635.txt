Stir coconut milk until it is uniformly smooth. Pour 1/2 cup portions into paper cups or a muffin tin. Freeze until solid, about 4 hours or overnight.    
Place a single 1/2 cup portion of frozen coconut milk in the container of a blender. Add cold brew concentrate, ice cubes, sugar, and salt. (Keep the remaining portions of coconut milk in the freezer for other frappes.)    
Blend until smooth and creamy.    
Pour into a glass, top with whipped cream. Drizzle chocolate and caramel ice cream toppings over the whipped cream.
