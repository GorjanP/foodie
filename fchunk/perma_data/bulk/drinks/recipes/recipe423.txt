In a large saucepan on medium-low heat, combine wine, sugar, and cinnamon. Cut the orange in half, push the cloves into the outside of the orange halves, and place them into the wine.    
Heat slowly on low heat for about 30 minutes or until steaming; do not let it boil. Heat your glasses in warm water before serving.
