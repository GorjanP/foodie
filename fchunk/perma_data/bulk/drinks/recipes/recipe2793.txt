Put ice in pint glass. Pour the lime juice, pepper vodka, simple syrup, orange juice, and passion fruit puree over the ice.    
Stir the vodka mixture together and strain into a martini glass.    
Drizzle the pomegranate juice down the inside of the glass to create a color separation.    
Garnish with the chile pepper slice.
