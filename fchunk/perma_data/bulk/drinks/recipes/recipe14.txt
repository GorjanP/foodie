Combine the cocoa, sugar and pinch of salt in a saucepan.  Blend in the boiling water.  Bring this mixture to an easy boil while you stir.  Simmer and stir for about 2 minutes.  Watch that it doesn't scorch.  Stir in 3 1/2 cups of milk and heat until very hot, but do not boil!  Remove from heat and add vanilla.  Divide between 4 mugs. Add the cream to the mugs of cocoa to cool it to drinking temperature.
