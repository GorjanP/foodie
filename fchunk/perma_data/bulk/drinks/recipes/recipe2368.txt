Place milk and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and simmer, stirring, until chocolate is melted but not boiling, about 5 minutes.    
Pour chocolate mixture into a blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; blend until foamy. Pour into a mug. Break the chile into 2 or 3 pieces, discarding seeds, and drop into the hot chocolate. Drink immediately.
