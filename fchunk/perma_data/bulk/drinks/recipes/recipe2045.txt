Place about half the rice and 2 cups water in a blender; pulse until rice is roughly ground.    
Pour about 3 cups more water in blender and add 2 cinnamon sticks; blend until cinnamon sticks are broken to pieces.    
Pour rice mixture into a large pitcher.    
Repeat the steps until all the rice, water, and cinnamon sticks are blended and poured into the pitcher.    
Cover and refrigerate pitcher for at least 4 hours to overnight.    
Strain rice mixture through a sieve into another pitcher or bowl and discard rice and cinnamon.    
Stir soy milk, sugar, and vanilla extract into the strained liquid; chill until ready to serve.
