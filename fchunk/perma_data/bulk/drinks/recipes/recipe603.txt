Fill a shaker half way full with ice. Pour in the lemonade, club soda and sugar. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the shaker. Pour in the vodka, cover and shake well. Strain into two glasses that are filled half way with ice. You can add oranges and cherries for garnish and make your drink look real pretty but hey, do you really want to do all that after work?  Enjoy!
