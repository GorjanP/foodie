Bring water to a low boil in a large saucepan. Stir sugar into water to dissolve. Add tea bags to water; set aside off heat to steep for 5 minutes.    
Mix tea mixture, lemonade concentrate, orange juice concentrate, and bourbon together in a large container.    
Put mixture in the freezer, breaking chunks into smaller pieces every few hours, until consistency is slushy but kind of flaky, melty frozen, about 24 hours.    
Scoop a few of large heaping spoonfuls of the slush into a glass; then top off with ginger ale and garnish with mint to serve.
