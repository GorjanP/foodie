In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil, and stir in the cumin seeds, star anise pod, and cinnamon stick; reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the instant coffee, and allow the drink to simmer gently for 2 more minutes. Pour the drink into mugs, straining out the spices, and stir 1 teaspoon of nonfat dry milk powder and 1 teaspoon of white sugar into each mug.
