Place the guava nectar, ginger ale, and pineapple preserves in the refrigerator and chill for at least one hour.    
Whisk together the chilled guava nectar, ginger ale, and pineapple preserves in a large punch bowl.  Stir in the frozen mango chunks and 1/2 of the softened orange sherbet, mixing until the sherbet is fully blended into the punch.    
Use a small ice cream scoop to scoop the remaining sherbet into the punch bowl. Serve immediately.
