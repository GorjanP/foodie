Pour the sweet and sour mix, tequila, cointreau, and raspberry liqueur into a shaker filled with ice. Shake until the shaker is frosty on the outside. Rub the rim of a margarita glass with a lime wedge, then dip in salt. Add a few ice cubes to the glass, then strain the liquid from the shaker carefully into the glass. Garnish with a lime wedge.
