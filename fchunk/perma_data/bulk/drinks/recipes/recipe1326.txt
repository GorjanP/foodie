Store a cocktail glass in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes before making the cocktail.    
Pour the anise flavored liqueur into the frosted glass and turn to coat the sides. Dump excess liqueur in the sink (or drink it!). Add sugar, water and bitters to the glass, stirring to dissolve. Strain into the glass and pour in the rye. Stir and garnish with a twist of lemon.
