Put the rice in a small skillet and toast over medium-low heat until it turns dark in spots. Move to a small saucepan. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat and allow to steep 3 minutes more. Add the tea and let it steep another 3 minutes. Strain and discard the rice and tea leaves from the liquid. Serve the tea hot.
