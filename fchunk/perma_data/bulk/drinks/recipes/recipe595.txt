In a large jar or pitcher combine wine and rum with sliced lemon, orange, lime, and strawberry. Push cloves into apples slices and add to mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight (the longer the better).    
To serve,  pour a tall glass half-full of wine mixture. Fill the rest of the glass with soda and stir gently. Remove cloves from apple slices and garnish drinks by spooning some marinated fruit into glass.
