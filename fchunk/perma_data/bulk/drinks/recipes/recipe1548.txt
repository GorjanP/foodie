Spread the graham cracker crumbs onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rims of 2 martini glasses with the lime wedges; reserve the lime wedges. Dip the moistened glasses into the graham cracker crumbs and set aside. Reserve the lime wedges and remaining graham cracker crumbs to use as a garnish.    
Pour the vodka, melon liqueur, pineapple juice, almond syrup, and whipped cream into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the rimmed glasses. Place a lime wedge on the edge of each glass and sprinkle the cocktails with some of the reserved graham cracker crumbs to garnish.
