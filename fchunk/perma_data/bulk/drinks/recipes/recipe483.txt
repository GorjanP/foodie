Place the strawberry basil leaves, and sugar into a cocktail shaker, and mash well with a cocktail muddler. Add half of the ice to the cocktail shaker, and place the rest into a tall glass. Pour in the gin and lemon juice, cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the chilled glass over the ice, top with the club soda, and stir to serve.
