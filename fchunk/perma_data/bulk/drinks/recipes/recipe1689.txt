Combine apple juice, apple cider, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, vanilla extract, and cloves together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sugars are dissolved, about 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and cool completely, about 1 hour.    
Stir grain alcohol and vodka into apple juice mixture. Remove cinnamon sticks and set aside. Pour moonshine into bottles; add 1 cinnamon stick per bottle and seal. Store moonshine in refrigerator.
