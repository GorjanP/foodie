Stir water and sugar together in a pot; bring to a boil. Cook at a boil until sugar is dissolved and mixture forms a clear syrup, about 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature.    
Stir orange juice concentrate, pineapple juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate, and mashed bananas into syrup. Add enough water to make 5 quarts; stir. Pour into ice cube trays and freeze.
