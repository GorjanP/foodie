Split vanilla bean lengthwise with the tip of a sharp knife. Place Urfa biber in a tea infuser.    
Combine vanilla bean, Urfa biber, milk, and cinnamon stick in a pot.    
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until milk is steaming and small bubbles appear, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove Urfa biber. Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate and sugar; stir until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Remove cinnamon stick and vanilla bean.    
Pour into cups and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with bittersweet chocolate.
