Pour the graham cracker onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of 1 chilled martini glass and dip the moistened glass into the graham cracker; set aside.    
Pour the pumpkin pie filling, rum, maple liqueur, and half and half into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared glass, and garnish with whipped cream to serve.
