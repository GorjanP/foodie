Cut the top of the coconuts to expose the soft meat inside. Pour the juice into a large bowl. Chop the coconuts in half; use a spoon to scrape the meat from the coconuts and add to the bowl with the juice. Add the water and sugar to the bowl; whisk until the sugar dissolves completely. Divide the ice between two tall glasses and pour the mixture over the ice to serve.
