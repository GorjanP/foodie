In a large saucepan, combine the eggs, milk and 1/3 cup sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture coats a metal spoon.    
Remove from heat.  Cool quickly by placing pan in a sink or bowl of ice water and stirring 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the vanilla.  Chill 4 to 24 hours.    
Before serving, whip the cream and 2 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form.  Transfer chilled egg mixture to a punch bowl.  Fold in whipped cream mixture and serve at once.  Sprinkle each serving with nutmeg.
