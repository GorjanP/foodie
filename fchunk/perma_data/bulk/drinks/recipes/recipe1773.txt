Whisk together the nonfat milk, evaporated milk, sucralose sweetener, nutmeg, and egg yolks in a heavy saucepan. Warm over very low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Pour the eggnog through a strainer. Stir in vanilla extract. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.    
Just before serving, stir in dark rum, if using.
