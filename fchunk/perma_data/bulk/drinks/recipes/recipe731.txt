Bring a large pot of water and sugar to boil. Cool. Stir in daiquiri mix, vodka, orange juice and strawberries. Transfer mixture to a freezer-safe container, and freeze until mixture is to your desired consistency.    
To serve: Pour into a chilled glass, approximately 2/3 cup of the slush mixture and 1/3 cup of lemon-lime soda.  Delicious.
