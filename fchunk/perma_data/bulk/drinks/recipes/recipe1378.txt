Place ice cubes in a shaker. Pour bourbon, maple syrup, orange liqueur, clementine juice, and lemon juice over ice, cover the shaker, and shake until chilled, about 15 seconds. Strain into a chilled martini glass.    
Light a match or lighter over the cocktail and squeeze 1 piece of clementine peel near the flame to flame the oil. Rub peel on the rim of the glass and drop peel into cocktail.
