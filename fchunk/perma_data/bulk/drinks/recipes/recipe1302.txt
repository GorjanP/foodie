In a saucepan over low heat, stir together the sugar, cocoa powder and chili powder. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add water and bell pepper strips, and mix well. Bring to a simmer, and stir in milk. When the mixture is heated to your liking, remove the pepper strips with a slotted spoon. Add cherry brandy if using, and serve.
