Place ice cubes into a cocktail shaker, and pour in tomato juice, gin, lemon juice, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, celery salt, pepper, and horseradish. Cover and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Pour contents (including ice) into a 12 ounce highball glass. Garnish with celery, pickle, olives, and lemon wedge before serving.
