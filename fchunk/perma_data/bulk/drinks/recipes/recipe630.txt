Mix vodka, brandy, orange and lemon juice concentrate, cherries and grapefruit soda together in a large plastic mixing bowl. Cover the mixture with a tight fitting lid. Freeze the mixture for one or two days.    
When you are ready to serve the drink, use an ice cream scoop and place one or  two scoops  of the mixture into glasses. Fill the rest of the glass with lemon/lime flavored soda pop. Stir and serve.
