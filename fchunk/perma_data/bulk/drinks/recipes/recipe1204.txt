Steep tea bags in boiling water until the tea is of desired strength, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and discard tea bags.    
Combine 1 1/2 quarts water, cloves, and cinnamon together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Stir brewed tea, pineapple juice, sugar, orange juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate, and allspice into the boiling water to dissolve the sugar. Serve immediately or reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer until ready to serve.
