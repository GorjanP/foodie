Salt the rims of 2 large margarita glasses. To do so, pour salt onto a small plate, moisten the rims of the glasses on a damp towel and press them into the salt.    
In a pitcher combine limeade, pineapple juice, orange juice, tequila and orange liqueur. Stir well and pour into the glasses, being careful not to rinse off the salt.
