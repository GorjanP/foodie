In a medium bowl, stir together the gelatin mix and boiling water until completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in vodka. Pour the liquid into small paper cups or portion cups. Chill until set, at least 2 hours.    
Pour champagne into glasses. Break up the gelatin with a fork, and pour into a glass of champagne. A little stir gives it some 'lava' action. Drink with caution, these will sneak up on you.
