Boil the sugar and water together in a large saucepan over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the vinegar and minced ginger.    
Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, then strain out the minced ginger with a fine sieve.  Store at room temperature in a sterile container.    
To use, stir 1 part syrup into 4 to 5 parts water; serve cold with ice if desired.
