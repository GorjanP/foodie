Squeeze the lime quarters into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss the juiced limes into the pitcher along with the mint, strawberries, and sugar. Crush the fruits together with a muddler to release the juices from the strawberries and the oil from the mint leaves. Stir in the club soda until the sugar has dissolved. Pour into the sugared glasses over ice cubes to serve.
