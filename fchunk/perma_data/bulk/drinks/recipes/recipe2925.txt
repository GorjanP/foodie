To Make the Basic Syrup:  Place sugar, 1 cup water and pandan leaves in a deep saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved. Remove pandan leaves and strain the syrup. Allow to cool for use as a basic syrup. Store the syrup in a bottle in the refrigerator.    
To Make the Cooler:  In a blender or food processor, puree the pineapple chunks. Strain and reserve the juice.    
In a deep saucepan, combine the pineapple pulp, 1 1/2 cups water, cinnamon stick and cloves. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, strain and discard pulp and spices. Allow the reserved liquid to cool.    
In a pitcher, combine spiced pineapple syrup and reserved pineapple juice. Stir in enough cooled Basic Syrup to sweeten to your taste. Chill in refrigerator.    
To serve, pour into glasses full of crushed ice.
