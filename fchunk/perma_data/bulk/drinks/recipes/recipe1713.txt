Stir together the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Rim a chilled martini glass in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Pour the vodka, schnapps, and cranberry juice into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the rimmed martini glass, and garnish with a slice of apple to serve.
