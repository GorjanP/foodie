In a small mug or coffee cup, mix the cocoa and Sweet'N Low together. Add a few tablespoons of the coffee and stir until the cocoa is completely dissolved. Pour in the remaining coffee.    
Foam the milk. Spoon a generous amount over the hot mocha. Garnish with a pinch of cocoa powder, if desired.
