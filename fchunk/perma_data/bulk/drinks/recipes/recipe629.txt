Beat the egg yolks with the vanilla. Beat in 1/2 cup of the scalded mixture into the egg yolks. Then whisk all the egg yolk mixture into the scalded mixture. Stirring mixture constantly, cook over low heat until mixture reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. DO NOT BOIL.
