Gently muddle lime juice with 8 mint leaves in a shaker using a wooden spoon or cocktail muddler.    
Add rum, simple syrup, bitters, and a handful of ice. Shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into a cocktail glass and top with Champagne. Garnish with a slice of lime and the remaining mint leaf.
