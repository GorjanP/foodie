Pour schnapps into a small fluted glass. Put a teaspoon just above the schnapps, and slowly pour Southern Comfort onto the spoon, letting it run in a separate layer on top of schnapps. Do not mix, it must be layered.    
Hold the glass away from face, and light the Southern Comfort with the flame of a match or lighter. Let it burn for 15 seconds. Blow it out and down it.
