Combine the ground coffee, red pepper, cloves, and cinnamon stick in a coffee filter set into a drip coffee brewer. Pour the water into the brewer's water reservoir. Set the coffee brewer on to brew.    
While the coffee brews, gently warm the coconut milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the honey until the honey is dissolved. Pour the brewed coffee into the mixture; stir. Divide the liquid into two mugs to serve.
