Combine tomato and clam juice cocktail, thawed frozen orange juice concentrate, and lime juice in a large pitcher; mix.    
Stir the Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and 2 tablespoons salt through the cocktail mixture until the salt has dissolved.    
Pour 1/4 cup salt for rimming glasses onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of a large beer glass with a wedge of lime, dip the moistened rim into the salt. Tap off excess.    
Fill the rimmed glass with ice. Pour 1/3 to 1/2 cup michelada mix, or to taste, over the ice. Fill the rest of the glass with beer and stir to serve.
