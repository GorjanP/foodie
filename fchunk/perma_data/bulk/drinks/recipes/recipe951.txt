In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the bourbon, rum, half and half and nutmeg.    
In a separate chilled bowl, whip the cream until it can stand in a peak. Fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture. Pour into a plastic container and refrigerate overnight (if possible). Shake the container before serving.
