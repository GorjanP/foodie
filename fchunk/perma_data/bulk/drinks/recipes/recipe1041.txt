Mix together the tea, water, vodka, orange juice concentrate, and pink lemonade concentrate in a large freezer-proof bowl, such as glass or stainless steel, and freeze overnight or several days ahead. With a fork, scrape the frozen mixture into a slush; pour the grapefruit soda into the slushy mixture, and stir. Keep cold in an ice chest.
