Beat the eggs and sugar together in a very large bowl until thick and light-colored. Stir in the bourbon and rum, mixing until sugar has dissolved. Let stand about 1 hour.    
Meanwhile, whip the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form.    
Stir the whipping cream and half and half into the egg yolk mixture until thoroughly blended. Slowly stir in the brandy. Fold in the egg whites, blending evenly. Cover and refrigerate two hours before serving. May be stored in the refrigerator up to one week.    
Serve in small cups or glasses dusted with a pinch of nutmeg.
