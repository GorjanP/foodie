Fill a tall glass with coffee ice cubes. Pour in the cold brewed coffee. Sweeten to taste with Sweet'N Low. Add milk as desired.    
To Make Cold-Brewed Coffee: Place the coffee in a glass jar, add the water, and stir to combine. Cover and set aside at room temperature for 12 hours or overnight.    
Strain the coffee through a large-size paper coffee filter, a fine sieve, or a strainer lined with cheesecloth. Cold-brewed coffee can be refrigerated in a covered jar for up to 24 hours. This recipe can be doubled.
