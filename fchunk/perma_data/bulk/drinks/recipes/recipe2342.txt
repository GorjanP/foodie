To make the coca extract, moisten coca leaf powder with 3 ounces of grain alcohol. Then pack the wet leaves into a percolator and add more diluted alcohol until the leaves are fully saturated and slightly covered by alcohol. When the extract begins to drip from the percolator, stop up the hole, cover the percolator tightly and allow to macerate for 2 days. Then continue the percolation, adding more alcohol until you have 8 ounces of extract.    
To make the flavoring, combine drops of orange oil, lemon oil, nutmeg oil, coriander oil, neroli oil, and cinnamon oil with 1/2 cup of grain alcohol.    
To make the syrup, mix together water, sugar, caramel, and 1/8 ounce (or 3/4 tablespoon) of coca extract. Stir in vanilla extract, caffeine, lime juice, and citric acid. Combine 1/4 ounce flavoring with the entire amount of syrup.    
To prepare Kook-a-Cola, combine 1 part flavored syrup to 5 parts carbonated water.
