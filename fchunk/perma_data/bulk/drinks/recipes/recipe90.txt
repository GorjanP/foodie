Cut banana into small pieces and place into the bowl of a blender.  Add the soy milk, yogurt, flax seed meal, and honey.  Blend on lowest speed until smooth, about 5 seconds.  Gradually add the blueberries while continuing to blend on low.  Once the blueberries have been incorporated, increase speed, and blend to desired consistency.
