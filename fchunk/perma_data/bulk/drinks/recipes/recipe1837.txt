Place lavender petals and mint leaves into a saucepan, pour water over lavender and mint, and bring to a boil. Turn heat to low and simmer tea until flavor is your desired strength, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain out mint and lavender petals and serve tea hot. If you prefer, let strained tea cool serve over ice.
