Place water, sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, and cardamom in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add tea bags. Let tea steep and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.    
Remove tea bags and strain out whole spices; discard. Whisk in condensed milk. Pour into a large pitcher and refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 1 hour.    
Fill 4 glasses with ice. Serve tea over ice.
