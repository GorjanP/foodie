Pour the light rum, amber rum, pineapple juice, sweet and sour mix, cream of coconut, and half-and-half cream into the pitcher of a blender with ice; blend until the cocktail has a slushy texture. Pour the slushy mixture into a glass.    
Slowly and gently drizzle the dark rum over the drink so it just floats on top; serve.
