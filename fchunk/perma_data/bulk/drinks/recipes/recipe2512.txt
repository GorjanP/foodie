Stir rum and sugar together in a large pitcher to dissolve the sugar; add apple slices, orange slices, lemon slices, and lime slices.    
Crush fruit slightly against the bottom of the pitcher to squeeze some juice into the rum mixture. Pour wine and orange juice into the pitcher; stir. Add lemon-lime soda and stir just before serving.
