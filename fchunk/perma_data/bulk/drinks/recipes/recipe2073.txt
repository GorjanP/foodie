Bring 6 cups of water, barley flour, and whole barley to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour. Remove from the heat and refrigerate until cold.    
Whisk the yogurt with 1/4 cup of water; stir into the cooked barley. Season to taste with salt. Serve chilled as a cool drink.
