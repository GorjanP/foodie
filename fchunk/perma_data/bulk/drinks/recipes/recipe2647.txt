Place 2 lemon wedges, 4 Thai basil leaves, and sugar in a cocktail shaker and mash well with a cocktail muddler. Pour in vodka and ice cubes; cover and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted, about 45 seconds. Strain into 2 chilled martini glasses and garnish each with 1 lemon wedge and 1 Thai basil leaf.
