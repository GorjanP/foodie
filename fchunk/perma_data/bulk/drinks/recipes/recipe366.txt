In a blender combine limeade, beer and tequila. Fill blender to the top with ice. Blend until thick and smooth.    
Salt the rims of 2 large margarita glasses. To do so, pour salt onto a small plate, moisten the rims of the glasses on a damp towel and press them into the salt.    
Serve the margaritas in the salted glasses and garnish with slices of lime.
