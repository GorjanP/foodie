Sprinkle salt on a small plate. Lightly wet the rim of a cocktail glass or margarita glass with a damp paper towel. Dip the moistened rim in salt to coat. Set aside.    
Combine tequila, orange-flavored brandy, and lime juice in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake until chilled. Strain into a salt-rimmed cocktail glass or a salt-rimmed, ice-filled margarita glass.    
Garnish with a lime wheel.
