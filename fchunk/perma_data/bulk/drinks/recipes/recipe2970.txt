Remove 1/2 cup of the boiling water and set aside to cool to lukewarm.    
Combine remaining boiling water, 2 cups sugar, ginger, honey, and lime juice in a large plastic container.    
Mix the 1/2 cup lukewarm water, 1 cup sugar, and yeast together in a separate bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy paste, about 5 minutes; stir into ginger mixture. Cover container and let sit for 3 days. Skim foam from top, strain liquid, and pour ginger beer into clean storage containers; chill.
