Combine water, sugar and chopped mint leaves in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Allow syrup to cool, approximately 1 hour.  Pour syrup through a strainer to remove mint leaves    
Fill eight cups or frozen goblets with crushed ice and pour 4 ounces of bourbon and 1/4 cup mint syrup in each.  (Proportions can be adjusted depending on each person's sweet tooth).  Top each cup with a mint sprig and a straw.  Trim straws to just barely protrude from the top of the cups.  Serve juleps on a silver platter.
