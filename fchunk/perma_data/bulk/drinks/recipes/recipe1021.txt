Press cloves into the peel of the lemon slice all the way around. Set aside. Measure the sugar into a wine glass. Place a metal spoon into the glass with the curved side facing upwards. Pour the boiling water over the back of the spoon. This will keep your wine glass from shattering. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Pour in the whiskey and add the lemon slice. Let steep for about 1 minute before drinking.
