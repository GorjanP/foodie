Put cucumbers, basil leaves, lime slices, rum, and raw sugar cubes into a metal cocktail shaker. Mash mixture together with a muddler until the sugar cubes have dissolved. Add ice, place lid onto the shaker, and shake vigorously; strain into a chilled glass tumbler filled with ice. Top cocktail with club soda and garnish with cucumber wedge and basil sprig.
