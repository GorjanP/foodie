Preheat oven and prepare the baking mix according to package directions for rolled biscuits, adding 2 teaspoons vanilla with the measure of water listed in the package directions. Roll out or pat dough into 6-inch circle on lightly floured surface; cut into 6 wedges. Place, 2 inches apart, on ungreased baking sheet. Brush tops lightly with additional water; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.    
Bake according to package directions.    
Mix 1/2 cup water and granulated sugar in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened, to a syrup-like consistency. Remove from heat; cool slightly. Stir in remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla. Pour over the fruit in large bowl; toss gently to coat.    
Split biscuits horizontally in half. Place bottom halves of biscuits on 6 dessert plates; cover evenly with half of the fruit mixture. Top each with a serving of Reddi-wip and top half of biscuit. Spoon remaining fruit mixture evenly over biscuits; top with additional serving of Reddi-wip.
