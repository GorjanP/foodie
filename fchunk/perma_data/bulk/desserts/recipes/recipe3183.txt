Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spread pie filling in an 8x8 inch baking dish.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg.    
Cream together margarine and sugar.  Cut in flour with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle mixture over pie filling.    
Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, until topping is brown and crisp and filling is hot and bubbly.
