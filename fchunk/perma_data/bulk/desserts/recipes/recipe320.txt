Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add sifted flour, and mix well. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and place on cookie sheets. Imprint your thumb in the center to make a 1/2-inch indentation. Fill with your favorite preserves.    
Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown at the edges.
