Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.    
Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, applesauce, vanilla extract, baking soda, and baking powder with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add flour, ground cinnamon, and salt, and stir until dough is just combined. Fold in oats, raisins and chocolate chips.    
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the the preheated oven until edges are golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
