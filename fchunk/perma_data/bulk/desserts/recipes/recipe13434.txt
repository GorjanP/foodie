Mix ground flax and water in a bowl; let sit until thickened, about 10 minutes.    
Combine flour, baking powder, and ground anise seeds in a bowl; mix until well combined. Add flax mixture, almond butter, brown sugar, and anise extract; mix well until a soft dough forms. Shape into 2-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheets. Flatten balls lightly with your hand.
