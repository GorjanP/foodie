Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans.    
In large bowl, blend cake mix, oil, water, undrained pineapple, eggs, and nuts.  Beat for 2 minutes with an electric mixer at medium speed.  Spread batter into prepared pans.    
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool.  Frost with cream cheese frosting.
