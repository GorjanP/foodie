Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)    
In a large mixing bowl, combine blackberries, sugar and tapioca. Be careful not to damage the berries. Pour into pie crust. Cover with top crust, seal and crimp edges, then cut slits in the top for steam vents. Top with pats of butter.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
