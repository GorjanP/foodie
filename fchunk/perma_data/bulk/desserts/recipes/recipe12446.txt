Whisk 2 cups cold milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until combined. Refrigerate until ready to use.    
Combine cream cheese and whipped topping in a medium bowl. Add confectioners' sugar and mix thoroughly.    
Cover the bottom of a 2-quart bowl or 9x13-inch pan with a layer of graham cracker squares. Spread about 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture on top. Top with 1/4 cup cookie crumbs. Cover with another layer of graham crackers and 1/3 of the pudding. Add a layer of strawberries and 1/4 cup chocolate toffee bits.    
Repeat layers until bowl is filled. Break remaining graham crackers into thirds and place along the edge of the bowl; add remaining strawberries. Top with any remaining cookie crumbs or toffee bits. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
