Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x7 inch baking pan.    
In medium sauce pan, over low heat, combine butter or margarine, brown sugar and honey. Cook, stirring, until butter or margarine is melted and sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat. Add oats, nuts, coconut and sesame seeds. Mix with a wooden spoon until well combined. Press mixture evenly into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is golden brown. Let cool in the pan and cut into bars.
