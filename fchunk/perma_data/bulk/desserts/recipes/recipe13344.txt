Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine water and flax seeds in a small bowl. Let stand, 5 to 10 minutes.    
Pour water and flax seeds into a blender. Add agave, unsweetened chocolate, and vanilla extract; blend on high speed until combined.    
Mix rye flour, cacao nibs, cacao powder, brown rice flour, walnuts, lecithin, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in water mixture; mix well until dough is combined.    
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart on the lined baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes.
