Combine watermelon, lemon juice, and sugar in a blender; blend until smooth and foamy.    
Pour blended mixture into a glass measuring cup through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing with a spoon to extract as much juice as possible; juice should measure about 1 3/4 cup.    
Pour watermelon juice into small glass dessert bowls. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours.
