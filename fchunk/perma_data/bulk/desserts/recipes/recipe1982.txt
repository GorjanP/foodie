Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place pie crusts into 9-inch pie dishes.    
In a food processor, place the navy beans, evaporated milk, melted butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, flour, sugar, vanilla extract, eggs, and egg yolks; pulse the mixture a few times, then process until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour the filling into the prepared pie crusts.    
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown, an additional 35 minutes. Cool before slicing. Eat warm or cold. Refrigerate leftovers.
