In a large bowl, mix oil, butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until creamy.    
Mix together cream of tarter, baking soda, flour, and salt.  Add these dry ingredients to the creamed mixture. Chill dough for 15 to 20 minutes.    
Roll dough into balls, and place on greased cookie sheets.  Press balls with a glass dipped in sugar to flatten.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 min.
