Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square pan.    
Remove and reserve tops of apples. Core the apples, leaving approximately 1/2 inch at the bottom. Arrange in the baking dish.    
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon red hot candies and cinnamon. Fill each apple with the mixture. Replace apple tops. Sprinkle remaining mixture over the apples.    
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until apples are tender.
