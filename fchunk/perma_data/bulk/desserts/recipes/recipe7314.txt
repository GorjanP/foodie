Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
To Make Butterscotch Filling: In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar, butter or margarine, and cream. Place over medium heat and stir constantly until mixture is browned. Remove from heat.    
In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar with flour. Mix well. In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks together with milk, then pour into flour mixture. Stir until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.    
Stir egg yolk mixture into browned cream mixture and return to heat. Cook until thick, stirring constantly. Pour mixture into baked pie shell.    
To Make Meringue: In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Add sugar gradually, continuing to whip until whites form stiff peaks. Spread meringue on top of pie.    
Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes, until meringue is lightly browned.
