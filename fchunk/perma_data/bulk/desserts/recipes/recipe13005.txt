Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cake mix and pudding mix together in a large bowl by hand. Add oil; mix well. Mix in egg. Add banana and mix until combined. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts until evenly distributed. Spread into a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, puffed, and slightly soft to the touch, about 25 minutes. Place on a cooling rack until set, at least 10 minutes.
