Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, mix together the cake mix, eggs and apple pie filling. Pour into the prepared pan. Combine the brown sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon and walnuts. Sprinkle over the top of the batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
