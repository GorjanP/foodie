Alternately add dry ingredients and brandy mixture to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Stir in the almonds and aniseed.    
Drop dough by spoonfuls onto prepared sheet, forming two 2 x 13-inch long strips on each sheet.  Smooth dough into logs with moistened fingertips.    
Bake about30 to 35 minutes or until golden and firm to the touch. Place cookie sheets on racks and cool completely. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F.    
Cut cooled logs on the diagonal into 3/4-inch thick slices using a serrated knife.  Place slices on cookie sheets.
