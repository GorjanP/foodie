Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Place the raisins or chopped dates in a bowl and cover with white wine. Set aside to soak.    
Cream the shortening with the brown and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and lemon and or vanilla extracts.    
Stir the flour, cinnamon and salt together.    
Dissolve the baking soda in 1/3 cup of the wine and beat it into the shortening mixture. Stir in the flour. Drain the soaked raisins and stir them and the walnuts into the dough.    
Drop tablespoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 10 minutes.
