Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine blueberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan with enough water to just cover; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until the berries pop and the sugar is dissolved completely, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch into 1/4 cup cold water; stir into blueberry mixture. Continue cooking blueberries until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes more. (Mixture will thicken as it cools.)    
Whisk milk, flour, 1 cup sugar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.    
Swirl melted butter in the bottom of an 8-inch square deep baking dish to coat. Pour batter over the butter. Sprinkle cinnamon over the batter; top with the berries mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until the batter is no longer wet, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle coarse sugar over the cobbler. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
