Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix together the flour, hazelnuts, baking powder, spices and salt. In a large bowl, cream the  shortening and powered sugar.  Beat in the lemon zest.  Gradually stir in the dry ingredients. Press the dough into an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan.    
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the top is golden.  Let cool in the pan or on a wire rack.
