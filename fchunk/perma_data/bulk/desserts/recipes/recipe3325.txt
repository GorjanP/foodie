Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10-inch tube pan.    
In large bowl, blend together cake mix, sour cream, oil, 1/4 cup white sugar, water, and eggs. Beat at high speed for 2 minutes. Pour 2/3 of the batter into prepared tube pan.    
Combine pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon, and sprinkle over batter in pan. Spread remaining batter evenly over filling mixture.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45-55 minutes until the cake springs back when touched lightly. Cool right-side-up in pan about 25 minutes.    
Mix together confectioners' sugar and milk.    
Remove cake from pan and drizzle with glaze.
