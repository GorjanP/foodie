In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup cocoa and 3/4 cup boiling water; set aside.    
In another small bowl, dissolve baking soda in the sour cream by stirring them together.    
In a large bowl, cream the 1/2  cup butter and 2 cups sugar. Gradually mix in the sour cream mixture and cocoa mixture alternately with the dry ingredients. Beat until fluffy. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold in the egg whites and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla.    
Grease a 9 x 13 inch pan and pour the batter into it. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 50 minutes. Frost with La Famiglia Chocolate Frosting (below).    
To Make La Famiglia Chocolate Frosting:  Cream 6 tablespoons butter or margarine in a small bowl.   Add 3/4 cup cocoa and confectioner's sugar alternately with milk; beat until spreading consistency. More or less milk can be used depending on the texture you want. Blend in the vanilla. This yields about 2 cups of frosting.
