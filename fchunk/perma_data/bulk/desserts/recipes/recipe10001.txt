Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the oil, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the rolled oats, cornflakes, coconut and peanuts. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls 3 to 4 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly.    
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top is lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool one minute on the baking sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
