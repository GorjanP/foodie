In a small bowl, combine the raisins and orange juice, soak overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and orange zest. Combine the flour, baking soda and oats, stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in the raisin mixture by hand. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.    
In a small bowl, combine the white chocolate and shortening. Melt over a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring frequently. When cookies have cooled, dip each cookie halfway into the chocolate, then scrape the excess off onto the side of the bowl. Set cookies on to waxed paper to dry.
