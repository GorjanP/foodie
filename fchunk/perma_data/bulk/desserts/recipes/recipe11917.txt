Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.    
Put 1 3/4 cups sugar, butter, cream cheese, baking powder, salt, and peppermint and vanilla extracts in a bowl. Cream together with a mixer until well blended, 2 or 3 minutes. Mix in egg until incorporated. Add 2 cups of the flour; mix on low speed until incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes (dough will be very soft).    
Divide dough roughly in half and transfer one half to another bowl. Mix in food coloring, if using, and remaining 1/2 cup flour into one half of dough. Mix cocoa powder into other half. Place 1/2 cup sugar in a small bowl.    
Pinch off about 1 teaspoon of green dough and roll into a small ball; repeat with remaining green dough. Do the same with chocolate dough. To make each cookie, line up 4 small balls of dough in a row, alternating colors: green, chocolate, green, chocolate. Squish the 4 small dough balls together and roll lightly into 1 big ball. Roll in sugar; set on prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between cookies. Repeat with remaining dough.    
Bake until cookie edges start to turn golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool on baking sheet 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
