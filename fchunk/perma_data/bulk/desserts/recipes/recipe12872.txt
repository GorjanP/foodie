Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix lemon pie filling, whole wheat pastry flour, sugar, arrowroot powder, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.    
Whisk vegetable oil, orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice, and salt together in a separate bowl. Pour over lemon pie filling mixture; stir until dough is crumbly and moist throughout.    
Drop 12 spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart onto an ungreased baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer gently to a wire rack; let cool until firm.
