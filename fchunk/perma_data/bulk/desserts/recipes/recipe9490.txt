Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place tart shells on a baking sheet; sprinkle raisins and walnuts evenly between shells.    
Whisk brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, egg, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; pour mixture evenly over raisins and walnuts into tart shells.    
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set and crust is golden, about 35 minutes.
