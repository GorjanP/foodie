Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Beat brown sugar, white sugar, and butter together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, anise seed, and ginger; mix well. Stir in flour and milk; mix until dough is thoroughly combined.    
Roll dough into approximately 50 marble-size balls; place on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
