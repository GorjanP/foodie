Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9 x 13 pan.    
In a small bowl, pour boiling water over oats.  Mix well, and cool.    
In a large bowl, combine butter or margarine, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, eggs, flour, baking soda, spices, and salt.  Add cooled oatmeal mixture, and stir to combine.  Pour batter into pan.    
Bake for 35 minutes.    
While cake is baking, combine 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, coconut, melted butter or margarine, vanilla, and cream in a mixing bowl.  Remove cake from oven, and turn on broiler.  Drop mixture by small spoonfuls on top of cake.  Spread evenly and carefully.  Broil for 2 to 5 minutes, until topping is bubbling and lightly browned.
