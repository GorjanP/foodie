Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.    
Beat butter and 3/4 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in egg, then stir in water and molasses. Gradually stir in flour mixture until just incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets; flatten slightly.    
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
