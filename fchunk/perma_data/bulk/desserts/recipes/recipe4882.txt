Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a sheet pan on a lower oven rack.    
Squeeze the end of each grape opposite the stem to separate skins from pulp. Set skins aside. Place pulp in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Press through a strainer or food mill to remove seeds.    
Combine pulp, skins, sugar, flour, lemon juice and salt. Pour into pastry shell.    
Combine oats, brown sugar and flour; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over filling.    
Cover edges of pastry with foil. Bake on sheet pan for 15 minutes. Remove foil, and bake 20 minutes more or until golden brown and bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.
