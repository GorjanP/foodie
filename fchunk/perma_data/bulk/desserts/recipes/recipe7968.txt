Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place pecans on a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped.    
Mix sugar, eggs, light corn syrup, dark corn syrup, butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; fold in pecans. Spoon 1/4 cup pecan mixture into each pie shell. Place pies on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until pies are slightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
