In a small glass bowl, microwave cherries with water on high for 2 minutes; drain, and set aside.    
In a separate microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate chips and candy coating together until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally. Stir in cherries and chopped pistachios, and spread into a wax paper-lined 15x10 inch pan. Chill for 1 hour, or until firm.    
Cut into 1 inch squares, and enjoy. Store unused portion in an air-tight container.
