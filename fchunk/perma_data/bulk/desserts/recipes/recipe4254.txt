Bring the water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Add the salt, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.    
Stir the milk, evaporated milk, almond extract, and sugar into the rice; add the cinnamon stick. Simmer uncovered, stirring frequently, until the dish is of pudding consistency, about 70 minutes more.
