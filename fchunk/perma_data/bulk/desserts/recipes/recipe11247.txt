In a large bowl, whip egg whites until stiff. Beat in the yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the confectioners' sugar, baking powder and anise oil. Mix in the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each, until dough is fairly stiff. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness. Flour a springerle rolling pin and carefully roll it over the dough, leaving the imprints. Cut cookies along the lines of the design and place them 1 inch apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Let cookies stand overnight in a cool place to dry.    
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the bottoms are  lightly browned.
