Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Beat butter and sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer or using an electric hand mixer on high speed until creamy and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract and mix well.    
Mix rice flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and baking soda into creamed butter mixture and mix on low speed until flour is moistened; increase speed to medium and mix until there are no longer lumps. Reduce mixer speed to low and add milk; mix until batter is well blended. Fill each prepared muffin cup with about 3 tablespoons batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
