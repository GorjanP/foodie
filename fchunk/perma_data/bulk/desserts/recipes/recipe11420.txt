Spread some whipped topping on the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Place 5 graham cracker sheets in the center. Break up 2 more sheets to cover the edges.    
Cover the top of the crackers with more whipped topping and then some sliced strawberries. Repeat layers 3 more times, ending with strawberries on top.    
Place chocolate chips in a resealable plastic bag and microwave at 10-second intervals until melted. Snip off 1 corner of the bag and drizzle melted chocolate over the strawberries. Refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 4 hours.
