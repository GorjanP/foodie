Cut nectarine all the way around and twist open. Remove pit. Sprinkle sugar on the cut side of each nectarine half.    
Place nectarine, cut-side down, onto a griddle or in a skillet over medium heat; cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer nectarines to a plate, cut-side up, and top each with plain yogurt.
