Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place almond flour, brown rice flour, sorghum flour, sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cardamom, ginger, and salt together in a large resealable bag; seal and shake well to combine.    
Mix butter and flour mixture together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined.    
Roll dough into walnut-size balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets; flatten balls slightly.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 27 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
