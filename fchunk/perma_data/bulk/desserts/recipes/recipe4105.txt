Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Peel pears and scoop out bottom core. Cut a small slice from the bottom so pears will stand upright. Place in a shallow baking dish and set aside.    
Melt butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over medium heat. Drizzle pears with melted butter and honey, and sprinkle with ground ginger (and lavender, if using). Cover with aluminum foil with the stems poking through foil.    
Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until tender. Baste with released juices occasionally during baking, and again just before serving.
