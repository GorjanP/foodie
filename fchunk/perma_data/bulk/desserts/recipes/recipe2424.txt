Combine whipped topping, condensed milk, sugar, vanilla, candy and salt in the freezer canister of an ice cream maker, stir.  Insert paddle, and fill with enough milk to reach 1 inch from top of canister (may be more or less than 2 cups).  Freeze according to manufacturer's directions.  (To freeze without an ice cream maker, use a 2 quart plastic container, fill with milk to two inches from the top and freeze in freezer, stirring every 15 minutes until hard.)
