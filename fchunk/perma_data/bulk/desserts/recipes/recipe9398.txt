Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Lightly grease and flour a 9x9-inch square pan and a 9-inch round pan.    
Stir together the cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth.    
Mix in the strawberry gelatin until combined.    
Divide the batter evenly between the 2 prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.    
Transfer the square cake onto a large platter.    
Cut the round cake in half, then arrange the cut side of the cake along two edges of the square cake to create a heart shape.    
Poke several holes on the top of the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon or spatula.    
Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the cake so that it runs into the holes; allow the milk to soak in.    
Spread the strawberry preserves on top of the cake.    
Fold the cream cheese frosting into the whipped topping in a bowl until just incorporated.    
Spread the frosting over the top and sides of the cake.
