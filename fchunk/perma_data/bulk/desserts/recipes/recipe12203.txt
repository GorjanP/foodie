Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil and lightly oil the paper.    
Whisk egg, coconut butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; add sugar and whisk until light and fluffy. Stir flour, trail mix, tapioca starch, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves into egg mixture until evenly-mixed. Drop dough by the teaspoonful 2-inches apart onto prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet until crisped, 5 to 10 minutes.
