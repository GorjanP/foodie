Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
On a lightly floured surface, knead dough lightly until smooth.  Roll out to approximately 1/8" and  prick all over with a fork. Cut dough into 36 fingers measuring 1 x 2 1/2 inches.  Place on cookie sheets. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg.  Brush cookie fingers with the egg and sprinkle each with sugar.    
Bake for about 15 minutes or until light golden  in color.  Let cool on wire racks.  Store in  an airtight container.
