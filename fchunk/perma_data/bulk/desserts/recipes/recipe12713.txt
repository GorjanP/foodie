Layer half the drained pears into the bottom of a glass baking dish with flat sides up. Fill the hollow in each pear with 1 or 2 pinches of cocoa powder. Place remaining pears on top of the first ones with flat sides down and hold the pear halves together with toothpicks. Refrigerate pears overnight.    
Before serving, whip cream in a chilled metal bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until cream is fluffy and forms soft peaks when beaters are lifted straight up, about 5 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium and beat pasteurized egg, confectioners' sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract into the whipped cream to make a foamy sauce.    
Place each pear (made of 2 halves) onto a serving dish, remove toothpicks, and drizzle with sauce to serve.
