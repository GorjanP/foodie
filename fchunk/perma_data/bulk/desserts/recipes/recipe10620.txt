Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Stir cream cheese, brown sugar, maple syrup, walnuts, cinnamon, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl until well mixed.    
Place apples, cut-side up, into baking dish, supporting them with pieces from the core underneath if needed. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons butter into each cored apple and top each with 1/2 the cream cheese mixture, filling the hole and covering the entire top of apple.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are slightly softened, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle apples with granola, pressing granola into filling. Continue baking until apples are cooked through and granola is browned, about 10 more minutes.
