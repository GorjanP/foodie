Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and confectioners' sugar. Stir in the butter and vanilla, and mix until a stiff dough forms. Pat dough into 9-inch round cake pan, and prick well  with a fork. Sprinkle remaining sugar over dough.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Cut into wedges while warm.  Cool on wire rack; separate cookies.
