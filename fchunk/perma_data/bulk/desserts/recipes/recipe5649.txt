Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees).  Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans or one 9 x 13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, blend cake mix with the water, eggs, and oil.  Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed for 4 minutes.  Stir in 2 cups coconut and nuts.  Pour into prepared pans.    
Bake for 35 minutes, or until done.  Cool completely.    
Melt 2 tablespoons butter or margarine in a skillet.  Add 2 cups coconut, and stir constantly over low heat until golden brown. Spread toasted coconut on absorbent paper towel to cool.    
Cream 2 tablespoons butter or margarine with softened cream cheese.  Add milk and sugar alternately, beating well.  Add vanilla, and stir in 1 3/4 cups of the toasted coconut.  Ice the cake, and sprinkle with remaining coconut.
