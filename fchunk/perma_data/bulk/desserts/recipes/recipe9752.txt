To Make Crust: In a large bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cup flour and salt. Cut in shortening until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water at a time to dough until it is moist enough to form into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, use hands to slightly flatten dough. Roll dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter.    
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9 inch deep dish pie pan with a piece of aluminum foil; it should cover bottom and sides of pan. Lightly flour the foil. Press the dough into the pan.    
To Make Filling: In a large bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently toss apples, raisins and walnuts with cinnamon mixture until coated. Fill the crust with the apple mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool.    
To Make Icing: In a small bowl, mix together confectioners' sugar, vanilla and milk. Drizzle over top of cooled pie.
