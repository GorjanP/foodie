Mix 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon together in a bowl.    
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; add bread cubes to skillet and turn frequently with a spatula to completely coat in butter.    
Reduce heat to low and cook bread cubes in butter until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over bread, stir to coat, and cook for 1 minute more.    
Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon white sugar over the bread cubes. Dust cubes with confectioners' sugar.
