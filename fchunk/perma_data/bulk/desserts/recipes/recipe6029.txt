Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 34 to 38 minutes. Poke holes into cake using a straw.    
Stir sweetened condensed milk and caramel topping together in a bowl; pour over warm cake and holes. Cool cake completely, about 1 hour.    
Spread whipped topping over cake and sprinkle toffee bits over whipped topping.
