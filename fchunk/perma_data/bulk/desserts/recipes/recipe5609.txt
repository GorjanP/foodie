Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet or line with parchment paper.    
Unroll puff pastry sheets on a dry, lightly floured surface. Sheets should be about 1/2 cm thick. Spread sugar liberally over the entire surface of each sheet. Tightly roll or fold up the pastry from each side of the sheet to meet in the middle. It will look like face to face snails.  Slice the roll into 1 cm slices, like a loaf of bread. Lay out on prepared cookie sheet about 2 cm apart. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.
