Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with lightly greased parchment paper.    
Soak dates in hot water until soft, 6 to 10 minutes. Drain.    
Combine dates, almond pulp, oats, almond milk, almond flour, coconut flour, coconut oil, applesauce, vanilla extract, cacao nibs, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a food processor. Process to the consistency of cookie dough, adding water if needed.    
Roll 1 tablespoon of cookie dough with your hands. Pinch sides with your fingers to form a square. Place on the prepared baking sheet and press down with your fingers or a fork to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool.    
Melt dark chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over cookies.
