Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; stir marshmallows into melted margarine until mixture is smooth. Mix green food coloring into marshmallow mixture until color is dark green.    
Gently stir regular and sugar-frosted corn flakes into marshmallow mixture until coated. Working quickly, drop the warm corn flakes mixture onto prepared waxed paper by tablespoon.
