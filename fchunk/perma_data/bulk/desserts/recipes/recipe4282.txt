Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, beat egg yolks and sweetened condensed milk with an electric mixer until doubled in volume. Gradually beat in the lemon juice while continuing to mix. Pour lemon mixture into graham cracker crust.    
In separate clean bowl, beat egg whites with vanilla extract until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in sugar, and continue beating egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Spoon meringue on pie.    
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.  Cool before serving.
