Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan combine caramels and 1/2 cup of evaporated milk. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth; set aside. Grease an 8x10 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, stir together the dry cake mix, melted butter and remaining 1/2 cup of evaporated milk. Press half of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan, reserving the rest.    
Bake for 6 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the pan from the oven and let cool slightly. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over the surface. Pour the caramel mixture over the chocolate chips, then top with the  remaining cake mixture. The top should be swirled with caramel and cake mixture.    
Return pan to the oven for an additional 18 to 20 minutes, until firm. Cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate for 1 hour before cutting into bars.
