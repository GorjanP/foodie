Combine confectioners' sugar, almonds, egg whites, and brandy in a blender; blend until all ingredients are sticking together and marzipan is formed. Press into a ball, cover in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours to get firm. Chill for an additional 6 to 12 hours if marzipan is not hard yet.    
Remove marzipan from fridge. Coat your hands slightly in confectioners' sugar and knead marzipan for about 1 minute. Separate marzipan into different portions, depending on how many and which fruits you'd like to make, and knead in food coloring to the different portions. To make the different fruits, start with a 1-inch ball of marzipan and give it the shape, details, and texture depending on the fruit you are shaping.
