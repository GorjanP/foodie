Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Lay the wonton wrappers out flat on a baking sheet. Brush evenly with melted margarine. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon sugar over the top of each one.    
Bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crisp. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
