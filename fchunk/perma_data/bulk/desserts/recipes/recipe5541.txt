In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine, eggs and confectioners' sugar; beat for 15 minutes.  Spread evenly in the graham cracker crusts.    
In each crust, place banana slices on top of sugar mixture; spread pineapple on bananas.  Spoon a little of the reserved juice over fruit.  Spoon whipped topping over fruit; garnish with cherries and pecans.  Chill before serving.
