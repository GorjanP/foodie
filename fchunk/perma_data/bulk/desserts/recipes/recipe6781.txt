Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9 x 13 inch pan.    
Sift together cake flour, baking powder, and salt.    
In a large bowl, combine shortening, sugar, yolks, and vanilla; beat with mixer.  Add sifted flour mixture alternately with milk in three parts; continue to beat until just blended.  Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake for about 35 minutes.  Remove from pan, and cool on a wire rack.  Ice with Fluffy Boiled Icing.  Sprinkle with coconut and chopped maraschino cherries if you wish.
