Peel grapefruit, removing all pith. Cut up into bite-size pieces. Drain in a strainer for 4 or more hours, collecting the juice. (This can be done the day before.)    
Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and 3/4 cup juice in a small saucepan; if the collected juice does not measure 3/4 cup, top it off with water. Bring to a boil. Stir in strawberry gelatin. Cool slightly.    
Spread grapefruit in the bottom of the baked shell, and pour gelatin over the fruit. Chill several hours or overnight.
