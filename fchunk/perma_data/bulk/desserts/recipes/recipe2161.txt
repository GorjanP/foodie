Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Combine the flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and Cheddar cheese. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.    
Toss the sliced pears with the lemon juice. Combine the 1/2 cup brown sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Add the sugar mixture to the pears and toss to coat.    
Transfer the pears to the pie crust and top with the crumble mixture.  Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
