Beat shortening ( or butter ) and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in molasses, egg and 3 tablespoons of flour.    
Sift together remaining flour and other dry ingredients.  Mix together the vinegar, water and buttermilk. Add alternately to the molasses mixture and beat batter until it is very smooth.    
Drop teaspoons of the mixture onto greased cookie sheets.   Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12-15 minutes.
