Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Break each graham cracker into 4 equal pieces, creating 48 total. Arrange graham cracker pieces closely together on a baking sheet.    
Melt margarine in a heavy pan over medium heat; add brown sugar. Cook and stir mixture until boiling and frothy. Boil for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and fold in pecans. Pour caramel mixture over graham crackers, spreading evenly.    
Bake in the preheated oven until caramel mixture has baked into the graham crackers, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from baking sheet immediately and cool on a sheet of aluminum foil.
