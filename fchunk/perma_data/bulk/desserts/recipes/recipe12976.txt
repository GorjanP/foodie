Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.    
Combine warm milk and melted butter in a bowl. Add yeast and stir until completely dissolved. Mix in eggs and cardamom. Stir in flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Cover with a clean towel and let rise for 1 hour.    
Punch dough down gently and divide into 20 pieces; shape into balls. Arrange balls on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Cover with a towel and let rise for about 45 minutes.    
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Bake until golden brown, about 14 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 20 minutes.    
Cut 1/2 inch off the top of each bun to make a 'lid.' Scoop out the core of the bun gently with a fork. Repeat with remaining buns, setting tops aside and placing cores in a large bowl.    
Pour some milk over the cores to moisten. Mix in almond paste until smooth. Continue adding small amounts of milk until filling resembles a thick pudding. Spoon almond paste filling into the center of the buns.    
Combine heavy cream and 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.    
Top buns generously with whipped cream and place 'lids' on top. Use a sifter to dust tops with confectioners' sugar.
