Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix flour, butter, and 5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until dough is golden; mix in walnuts. Roll dough into marble-sized balls; arrange on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until balls are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.    
Place 6 cups confectioners' sugar in a bowl; roll balls in the confectioners' sugar until completely coated; place balls on a plate to cool completely. Roll balls in the confectioners' sugar a second time.
