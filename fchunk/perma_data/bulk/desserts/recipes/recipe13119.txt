Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and stir.    
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread crackers on the prepared baking sheet. Pour the butter mixture over the top of the crackers. Sprinkle chocolate chips and almonds evenly on top.    
Freeze until the crackers are brittle enough to break apart, 30 to 45 minutes.
