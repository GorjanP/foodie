Soften the saffron threads in  the hot milk; set aside.  Heat oil over medium heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the semolina.  Cook until toasted and light brown, stirring constantly.    
Bring the milk to a boil in a separate saucepan.  Turn heat to medium-low and stir in the semolina and banana; cover and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the sugar, cover and cook for an additional minute.    
Meanwhile, in a separate pan, heat ghee over medium-high heat.  Add cashews and raisins; cook until the raisins puff.  Pour the raisins into the semolina, mix well, and cook covered for another minute.
