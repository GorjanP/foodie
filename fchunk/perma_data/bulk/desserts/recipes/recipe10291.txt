Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat 1 3/4 cups sugar, butter, eggs, and chai concentrate together in a bowl until light and fluffy. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined.    
Whisk 3 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.    
Form dough into 1-inch balls and roll each ball in cinnamon sugar to coat; place 2-inches apart on baking sheets.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
