Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Stir together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla, vegetable oil and milk. Blend in the flour mixture before stirring in the oats, frosted corn flakes and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
