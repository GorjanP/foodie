Chop almonds in a food processor and add medjool dates. Blend until smooth.    
Reserve about 1/8 cup of date mixture and set aside.    
Prepare two individual-sized tart pans with oil or line with parchment. Divide the date mixture among the two pans and press along the bottom and sides.    
In a mixing bowl, whip the culinary Coconutmilk with a hand mixer for a minute or so before adding the reserved date mixture and about 5 berries. Stir to combine.    
Spoon the coconut mixture into the tart crusts and pop in the freezer for at least 2 hours.    
Remove the frozen tarts from the pans. Garnish with raspberries and sliced strawberries.
