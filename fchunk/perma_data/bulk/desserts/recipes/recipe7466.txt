Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 x 13-inch pan.    
Mix cake mix, 1 egg, and butter; press into prepared cake pan. Top with chocolate chips and nuts.    
In a separate bowl, mix confectioner's sugar, 2 eggs, and cream cheese. Pour mixture over the cake mix base.    
Bake until cream cheese layer is bubbly and golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool before serving.
