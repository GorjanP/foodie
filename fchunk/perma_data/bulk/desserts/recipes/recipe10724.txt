Combine tomatoes, apples, brown sugar, raisins, vinegar, butter, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large saucepan; cook and stir over medium-low heat until bubbling and slightly reduced in volume, about 25 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool slightly, about 15 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.    
Pour green tomato filling into the pie crust; top with the second pie crust, crimping the edges together to seal.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Decrease oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
