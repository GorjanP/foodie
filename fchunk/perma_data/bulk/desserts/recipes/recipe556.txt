Cut the tops off of the strawberries and stand upright on the cut side.  Make a cut 3/4 of the way down from the tip of the strawberry towards the bottom.    
Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and liqueur until smooth in a mixer or a food processor.  Place into a piping bag with a star tip.  Pipe into each strawberry and arrange on a serving platter.
