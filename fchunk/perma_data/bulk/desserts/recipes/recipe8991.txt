Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 8 large custard cups onto a baking sheet.    
Chop the chilled cookie dough into 1/4 inch cubes and set aside. Mix the rhubarb with the sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Fill each of the custard cups half full with the rhubarb mixture.    
Spoon the strawberry pie filling over the rhubarb. Arrange the cubed cookie dough on top of the filling. Leave some open spaces between the cubes, so that the filling does not overflow when baking. There may be some cookie dough left over.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the dough is fully cooked and starting to brown around the edges, about 45 minutes.
