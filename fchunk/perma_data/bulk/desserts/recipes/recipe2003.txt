Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9x13 inch baking pan.    
Combine cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, 1 cup water and the vegetable oil and blend well. Beat at the medium speed of an electric mixer for 4 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes or until the cake springs back when lightly touched. Let cake cool in pan for 15 minutes.    
Meanwhile, dissolve the gelatin in the boiling water, then add the cold water.    
Poke holes in the warm cake with a fork at 1/2 inch intervals. Pour gelatin over cake. Chill cake for 3 to 4 hours then frost with whipped topping. Keep cake refrigerated.
