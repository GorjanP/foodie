Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, rolled oats, sugar, coconut and macadamia nuts. In a small saucepan, combine the water, honey and baking soda. Bring to a boil, then stir in the butter. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes, then stir into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon. Place tablespoons of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon. Leave about 3 centimeters between cookies.    
Bake for 12 minutes for chewy biscuits, 15 minutes for crunchy, in the preheated oven. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
