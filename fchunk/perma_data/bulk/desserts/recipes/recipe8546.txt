Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease 24 fairy cake cases (muffin cups) or line with paper liners.    
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add 1/2 of the flour and 1/2 of the eggs; whisk until smooth. Add remaining flour and eggs and whisk until batter is light and fluffy; spoon into prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
