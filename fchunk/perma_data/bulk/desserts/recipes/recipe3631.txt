Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Cream the sugar and butter.  Add flour, nuts, salt and vanilla.  Mix well.  Batter  will be very crumbly.    
Shape into 1 inch balls. Bake for 15 minutes, remove from oven and allow to cool for  3 minutes.  Roll in super fine sugar.  When cool, roll again, if desired.
