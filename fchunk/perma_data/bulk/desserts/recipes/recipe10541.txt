Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9-inch square baking pan. With a stand or hand mixer beat butter with Sugar In The Raw(R) and Stevia In The Raw(R) until creamy. Beat in molasses and egg. Beat in flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and salt on low speed. Then mix in water on low speed, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Pour mixture into prepared pan. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool completely and then cut into 1-inch cubes.    
To make butterscotch, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar, Stevia In The Raw(R), cream, and salt and whisk until combined. Bring to a gentle boil and cook for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool to room temperature.    
In a large bowl beat cream, Sugar In The Raw(R) and Stevia In The Raw(R) on high speed until stiff peaks form - about 1 minute. Keep whipped cream cold until ready to assemble trifle.    
To assemble, distribute half the gingerbread cubes amongst 10 individual serving dishes or jars. Top with some of the butterscotch sauce and whipped cream then top with the remaining gingerbread cubes, butterscotch, and whipped cream.
