Using an air popper, pop the popcorn, place into a large bowl, and discard unpopped kernels. Melt the confectioners' coating according to the package directions.    
Pour the melted coating over the popcorn, and sprinkle the crushed candy canes over the mixture. Using your hands, work the candy coating and crushed candy canes all through the popcorn. Let the mixture cool, and break apart into bite-size pieces.
