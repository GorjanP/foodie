Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line pastry with a double layer of aluminum foil and a layer of pie weights or dried beans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edge of crust is golden, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust has set, about 5 minutes more. Allow crust to cool.    
Bring water and pureed strawberries to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in sugar, gelatin, cornstarch, and salt until dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly.    
Arrange strawberries in pie crust and pour gelatin mixture over berries. Chill until gelatin is set or overnight.
