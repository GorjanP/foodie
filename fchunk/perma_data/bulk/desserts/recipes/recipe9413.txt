Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix flour, chocolate chips, sugar, oil, cocoa powder, almond milk, vanilla extract, and baking powder together in a bowl. Place dough on a flat work surface and split into 4 pieces. Flatten and mold cookies into the desired shape. Arrange cookies on a small baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, about 5 minutes. Cool until firm, 2 to 3 minutes.
