Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and baking powder. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, oil, orange juice and vanilla. Mix well and pour into prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
