Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl.  Whisk in the softened cream cheese, yogurt, and vanilla until smooth.    
Stir the apples, 1 1/2 cups of walnuts, and the dried cranberries into the cream cheese mixture until well coated.    
Spoon salad into a serving bowl and garnish with the remaining 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts.   Keep chilled until serving.
