Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat for 15 minutes using an electric mixer. Stir in the flour and baking soda, then fold in the pecans. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet.    
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
