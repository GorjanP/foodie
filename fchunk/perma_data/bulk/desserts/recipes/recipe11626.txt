Cut 10 strips of parchment paper, 2-inches wide by 16-inches long.    
Sift confectioner's sugar and meringue powder together in a bowl; beat in water and vanilla extract until smooth.    
Divide sugar mixture evenly into three bowls; beat in small amounts of different food coloring paste into each bowl until desired color has been achieved.    
Place a #3 pastry tip into end of pastry bag; fill with one of the tinted sugar mixtures. Pipe buttons about the size of a penny onto parchment strips, 3 rows across. Repeat with remaining tinted sugar mixtures. Dry until buttons are hard, about 8 hours.
