In a large mixing bowl, stir together gelatin and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water. Set aside to soften.    
Combine remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of water and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Do not stir once the sugar syrup begins to boil. Heat to 270 degrees F (130 degrees C).    
With an electric mixer running on low speed, carefully pour hot sugar syrup into gelatin mixture. Beat on high speed until mixture is light and fluffy and mixture is no longer warm to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and let set 8 hours or overnight. Cut into squares and serve.
