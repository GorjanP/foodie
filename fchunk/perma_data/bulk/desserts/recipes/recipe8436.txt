Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.    
In a mixing bowl, beat eggs, oil, 1 cup sugar and almond extract. Stir matzo meal, potato starch, salt, nuts and sprinkles into the mixture. Separate the dough in half and form 2 long, wide rolls. Place the rolls on the parchment paper.    
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and cut on an angle into 1/2  to 3/4 inch cookies while still hot.    
Stir the cinnamon and sugar together and pour into a shallow bowl. Roll the cookies in the cinnamon sugar mixture and return the cookies to the cookie sheet. Turn oven off and return the cookie sheet to the oven. Let the komish dry overnight.
