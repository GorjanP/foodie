Whisk milk and instant pudding mix together in a bowl for 2 minutes.    
Heat oil in a medium pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Unroll dough and cut each biscuit into quarters using a pizza cutter. Roll each quarter into a ball. Place 4 balls into the hot oil and cook until golden on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer cooked poppers to a wire rack. Break 1 popper open to confirm they are completely cooked inside. Repeat with remaining biscuit dough balls.    
Place cinnamon sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll poppers in cinnamon sugar until well coated.    
Fully submerge the tip of the flavor injector tool in the pudding. Slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the cavity with pudding. Insert the tip of the injector into a popper and carefully fill with pudding. Repeat with remaining poppers and pudding.
