Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium mixing bowl, cream together butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until smooth with electric mixer. Stir in flour and cornstarch. Pop dough into your cookie press, and away you go! Press cookies out onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the peaks are golden.
