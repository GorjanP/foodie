Mix half-and-half, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl. Freeze mixture until ice crystals form, about 1 hour. Remove mixture from freezer, stir to distribute ice crystals, and return to freezer until ice crystals form again, about 1 hour.    
Repeat freezing and stirring process twice. Cover the bowl with a lid and freeze until solid, about 2 hours.
