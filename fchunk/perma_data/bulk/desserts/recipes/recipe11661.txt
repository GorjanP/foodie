Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).    
Beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; beat in coconut, 1 egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.    
Combine flour, baking powder, salt, ginger, and cloves together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar and shortening together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add 3 eggs to creamed mixture, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat pumpkin into creamed mixture. Stir flour mixture into creamed mixture just until batter is moistened; fold in raisins and pecans.    
Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared pan; top with cream cheese filling. Pour remaining batter over filling.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool completely before removing from pan.
