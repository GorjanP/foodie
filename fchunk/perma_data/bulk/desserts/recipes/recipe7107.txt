Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.    
Combine the cake mix and the melted butter in a large mixing bowl. Mix until evenly moistened, then press into the prepared pan. Layer chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, miniature marshmallows, and coconut over the cake mix crust.  Pour the condensed milk over the layers.    
Bake 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Let cool before cutting into bars.
