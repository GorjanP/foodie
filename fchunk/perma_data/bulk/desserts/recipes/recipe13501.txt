Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 8x12-inch baking pan.    
Combine buckwheat flour, sugar, almond meal, oats, coconut flakes, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in coconut oil with a pastry blender until dough is well-mixed and crumbly.    
Mix yogurt, grapeseed oil, and milk together in a bowl. Add to buckwheat flour mixture. Fold in blueberries until just combined. Spread into prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
