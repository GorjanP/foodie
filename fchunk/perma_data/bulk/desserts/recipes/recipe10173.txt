On waxed paper, roll half of dough into 10 by 8 inch rectangle. Spread dough with half of the poppy seed mixture.  Starting at narrow side, roll jelly-roll fashion.  Wrap and refrigerate 1 hour, until firm.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
