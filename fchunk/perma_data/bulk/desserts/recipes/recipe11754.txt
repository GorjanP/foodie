Cut frozen marshmallows into smaller pieces.    
Layer graham crackers, marshmallow pieces, and chocolate chips on 4 tortillas, leaving a 1-inch border uncovered. Top with remaining 4 tortillas.    
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Cook tortillas until marshmallow pieces and chocolate chips are melted, about 2 minutes per side. Let cool for 1 minute; cut into 4 wedges.
