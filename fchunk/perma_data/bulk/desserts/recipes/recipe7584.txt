Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour,  baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour mixture, then stir in the fruit cocktail and syrup, mixing just until combined.  Stir in the walnuts and chocolate chips.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
