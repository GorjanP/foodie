Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Beat the margarine and 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and the almond extract until completely incorporated. Mix in the pudding mix until smooth. Stir in the flour until just incorporated, then fold in the chocolate chips, mixing just enough to evenly combine.    
Form the cookie dough into 1-inch balls, and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Use your thumb to make an indent into each cookie.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 10 to 14 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.    
While the cookies are cooling, prepare the filling by stirring 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar in a bowl with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, milk, and food coloring. Add additional milk as needed to make the mixture smooth. Spoon a little of the green filling into each cooled cookie, and top with a candy kiss.
