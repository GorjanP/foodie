Grease a 9x13-inch pan.    
Mix cake mix and confectioners' sugar together in a large microwave-safe bowl. Add butter and milk to the cake mix-sugar mixture without stirring.    
Heat in microwave for 2 minutes; stir immediately. Pour fudge into the prepared pan and refrigerate until set, 1 hour. Cut into squares.
