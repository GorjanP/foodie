Preheat oven to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter.    
Mix flour, sugar, milk, olive oil, orange juice, orange zest, eggs, baking powder, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in a large bowl until batter is well combined.    
Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool before serving.
