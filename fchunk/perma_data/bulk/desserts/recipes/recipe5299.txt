Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, peanut butter and 1/2 cup white sugar until smooth. Stir in the honey, molasses, egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger. Stir the dry ingredients into the molasses mixture until well blended. Roll dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Press a criss cross into the top with a fork.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
