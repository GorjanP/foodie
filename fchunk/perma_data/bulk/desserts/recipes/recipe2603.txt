In a large bowl, cream together shortening and both sugars until light and fluffy, using electric mixer at medium speed.    
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each.  Blend in vanilla.    
Gradually add dry ingredients to creamed mixture, mixing well with spoon.    
Stir in oats, dates and walnuts.    
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, on cookie sheet.    
Bake for 8 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove from cookie sheets to cool on racks.
