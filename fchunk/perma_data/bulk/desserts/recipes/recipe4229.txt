Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, melt butterscotch chips and butter, stirring constantly until smooth. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Stir in the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, vanilla and eggs until well blended. Mix in the mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Center will shake but it will firm upon cooling. Wonderful with ice cream.  Enjoy!!!
