Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire.    
Lay a sheet of dough onto a work surface. Spread fruit filling on top. Layer another piece of dough on top and seal the edges. Repeat with the remaining dough and pie filling. Place pies in pie irons.    
Place pie irons on the coals and cook until golden brown and heated through, about 1 minute per side. Serve hot.
