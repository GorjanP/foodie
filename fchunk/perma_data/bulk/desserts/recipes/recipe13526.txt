Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Combine 1 1/2 cups hot water, chia seeds, and flax seeds in a blender; let soak, about 10 minutes. Blend mixture on high until combined, about 1 minute.    
Combine millet flour, raw sugar, cacao powder, tofu, 1/2 cup warm water, agave syrup, 1/2 cup cacao nibs, almond meal, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Fold in raspberries. Pour blended mixture over flour mixture; mix until batter is combined.    
Scoop batter out onto baking sheets. Top each scoop with a few cacao nibs.    
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
