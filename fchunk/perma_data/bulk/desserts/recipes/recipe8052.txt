Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 - 8x4 inch loaf pans and line them with parchment or waxed paper.    
Beat eggs, salt and vanilla together until very light and lemon colored. Stir in sugar, 1 cup flour and baking powder.    
Place cherries, nuts, and dates into a large bowl. Dust with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Then stir in  sugar mixture. There is very little batter which makes this a very stiff mixture. Mix with hands.    
Press batter into prepared loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour.
