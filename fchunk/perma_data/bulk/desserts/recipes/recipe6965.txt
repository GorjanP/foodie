Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, beat together the egg yolks, sour cream, white sugar, vanilla and whiskey until smooth. Stir in flour until dough is stiff enough to knead. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Knead in additional flour if necessary. Divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces and roll each ball on floured surface.  Cut into strips about 3 inches long then make a slit long ways down the middle.  Pull one of the ends through like a bow.    
Place into hot oil and deep fry until golden  brown.  Let drain on paper towels and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
