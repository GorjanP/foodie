Add the flour mixture, and stir until just combined.  Stir the crushed cookies into the dough. Cover, and chill the dough for 1/2 hour.    
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
Drop dough by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove to cool on wire racks.
