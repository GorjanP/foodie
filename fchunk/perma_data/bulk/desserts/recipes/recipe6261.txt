Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Beat eggs, oil, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Stir pecans, flour, and vanilla into the egg mixture; pour into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
