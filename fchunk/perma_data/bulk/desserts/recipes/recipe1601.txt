Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat the shortening with the sugars and the peanut butter until well mixed. Beat in the egg and the water.    
Gradually beat in the flour, baking soda and salt. Form cookies on an ungreased baking sheet with a cookie press or roll into balls and smash flat with a floured fork or fingers.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes or more until done, usually when the puffed up cookie has lowered down to level. Before then it is more chewy.    
For High Altitude, omit water and add eggs last, mixing well, but not beating them  as at sea level. Raise the temperature to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). Or use a convection oven at 312 degrees F (155 degrees C) for 15 min works even better.
