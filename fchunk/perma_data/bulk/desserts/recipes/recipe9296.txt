Beat heavy cream until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the sweetener, continuing to beat until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the whipped cream should curl over slightly. Beat in the yogurt, cream cheese, and almond and vanilla extracts until well mixed. Fold in the green and red grapes. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.
