Take the sandwich cookies apart, scrape the cream filling into a bowl, and place the cookie halves into a large resealable plastic bag. Crush cookies into crumbs using a rolling pin.    
Whisk pudding mix and milk in a large bowl until smooth; continue whisking for 2 minutes. Allow to stand for 5 minutes to thicken. Beat sandwich cream filling and whipped topping into pudding until smooth. Beat cream cheese into pudding mixture until no longer lumpy, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix cookie crumbs into pudding mixture.    
Spoon the pudding mixture into a large resealable plastic bag, squeeze out the air at the top, seal the bag, and cut a small corner off one bottom corner of the bag.    
Set cookie cones upright in a large baking dish and squeeze the pudding mixture into the cones. Sprinkle a few candy worms on top of each cone. Freeze cones for 30 minutes to chill.
