Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Combine oats, flax seeds, hemp seeds, whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix bananas, butter, brown sugar, agave nectar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into oats mixture until batter is just mixed. Fold chocolate chips into batter. Drop batter by the spoonful onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are beginning to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
