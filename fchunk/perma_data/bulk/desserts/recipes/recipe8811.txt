Blend together the butter, egg yolks, vanilla, salt, confectioners' sugar and flour.    
Take small amount of dough in hand , flatted out and wrap around drained cherry.    ( I use a combination of red and green cherries and tint the icing to match the color of the cherry. )    
Bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown (about 10 minutes).    
Cool and dip in tinted butter icing.  Roll in coconut flakes.   ENJOY!
