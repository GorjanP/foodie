In a saucepan over medium heat, combine cranberry sauce and water. Heat until sauce melts. Stir in gelatin until it dissolves. Remove from heat. Mix in apples, oranges, walnuts, and yogurt.    
Pour mixture into a fancy gelatin mold or a nice bowl, and refrigerate overnight. To serve, dip briefly in hot water, and invert onto a serving dish.
