Heat milk, ground coffee, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and mint in a saucepan over low heat until warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes.    
Whisk egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar in a bowl; slowly whisk in about 1 cup hot milk mixture. Pour egg yolk mixture into saucepan and continue to heat until custard is thickened, about 5 minutes.    
Line a sieve with cheesecloth and strain custard into a large bowl; discard solids. Whisk heavy cream into custard. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, 4 to 5 hours.    
Stir rum and chocolate into chilled custard and pour into an ice cream maker. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions.
