Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until smooth. Sir in flour, and knead by hand until dough comes together. At first the dough will seem dry and crumbly but don't give up, keep mixing. Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, and cut with cookie cutters or press dough into shortbread molds. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, depending on the size of your cookies. Do not let them brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
