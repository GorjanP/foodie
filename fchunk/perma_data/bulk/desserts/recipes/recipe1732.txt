Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, white sugar, salt and peanut butter. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the batter to form a dough. Mix in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Scoop mounds of dough as large as two tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart. If batter is crumbly, roll portions of dough into rough spheres between the palms of your hands. Flatten cookies down by 1/3 using the bottom of a glass.    
Bake for 10 to 12  minutes in the preheated oven, until well risen and brown. Do not overbake they will firm up a little as they cool.   Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
