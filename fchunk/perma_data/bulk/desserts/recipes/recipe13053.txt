Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Mix cake mix, oil, and egg together in a bowl. Spread batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove pan and leave oven on.    
Pour frosting into a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave until warmed through, about 30 seconds. Pour frosting over the baked cake mix crust. Top with 1/2 the chocolate chips and 1/2 the almonds. Add marshmallows to cover. Top with remaining chocolate chips and almonds.    
Bake in the hot oven until top is a nice golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool before cutting.
