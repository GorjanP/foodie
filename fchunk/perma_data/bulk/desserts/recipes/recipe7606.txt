Place the doughnut pieces in a single layer in the bottom of a shallow dish. Pour just enough of the coffee over the doughnuts so the liquid is completely absorbed by the doughnuts. Put the dish in the freezer.    
Mix the remaining coffee with the sugar, cream, sweetened condensed milk, milk, and vanilla in a bowl; stir.    
Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until the ice cream cycle is completed. Fold the frozen doughnuts into the mixture; transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. Ripen in the freezer for at least 12 hours.
