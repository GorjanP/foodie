Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream the butter, egg yolk and anise extract until light. Stir in the 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and flour until blended.    
Shape dough into crescents and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven just until bottoms and edges begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Dust heavily with confectioners' sugar before they are completely cool.
