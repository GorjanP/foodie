Combine 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons wine, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and orange juice in a small bowl. Toss to coat the berries.    
Combine mascarpone cheese and heavy cream carefully in a separate bowl using a spoon or whisk. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and vanilla extract. Beat mixture together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth.    
Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons wine and peach tea together in a separate bowl. Dip each ladyfinger in the liquid once until coated but not extra soggy.    
Spoon a dollop of the mascarpone cream onto the bottom of a serving cup. Arrange a few ladyfingers to cover the bottom. Layer berries on top. Dollop on more mascarpone cream. Repeat to make a second layer. Repeat with each serving cup.    
Rap the bottom of each cup against the counter to expel excess air bubbles. Cover cups with plastic wrap; refrigerate tiramisu until cool and firm, 8 hours to overnight. Dust tops with white chocolate and confectioners' sugar.
