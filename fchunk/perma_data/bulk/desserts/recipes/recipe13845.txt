Prepare single baked pie shell according to package instructions.    
Combine milk, 1/4 cup coconut milk, 1/4 cup Truvia(R) Baking Blend, and salt in heavy bottom saucepan and bring slowly to a boil.    
Pour remaining 3/4 cup coconut milk into a separate bowl and stir in cake flour, corn starch, whole egg, and egg yolk. Beat until smooth.    
Pour about 1/4 cup of the boiling mixture into the egg yolks to temper them. Then gradually pour the egg yolks back into the boiling mixture while whisking. Stir until the mixture thickens.    
Remove the mixture from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla.    
Gradually add remaining Truvia(R) Baking Blend to egg whites while beating until soft peaks form. Gently fold beaten egg whites into the hot mixture and mix until just combined.
