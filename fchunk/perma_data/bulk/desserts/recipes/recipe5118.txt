Place chopped chocolate bars, marshmallows, milk, and salt in the top of a double boiler. Heat and stir until mixture is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool, stirring occasionally.    
In a medium bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form. Fold cream into cooled chocolate mixture. Pour mixture into graham cracker crust. Chill before serving. This pie is also delicious frozen.
