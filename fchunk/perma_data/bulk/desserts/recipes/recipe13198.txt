Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Combine 1 1/2 cup sugar and shortening in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in pumpkin puree and eggs.    
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, and cloves together in a bowl. Fold into shortening mixture until a sticky dough forms.    
Place 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow bowl. Shape spoonfuls of dough into small balls. Roll in sugar and place 2 inches apart on baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
