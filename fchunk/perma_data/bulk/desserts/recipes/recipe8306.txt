Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Place the rhubarb into one of the prepared pie crusts. Beat together the eggs, sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and flour until evenly blended; pour over the rhubarb. Use the remaining pie crust to create a lattice, and place on top of the pie.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking 45 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
