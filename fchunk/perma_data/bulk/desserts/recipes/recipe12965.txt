Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; add oats and salt. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add cream mixture, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and brown sugar; stir to combine. Cover and let stand for 2 minutes.    
Set oven rack 4 to 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease seven 6-ounce ramekins.
