Combine farmer's cheese, melted butter, and milk in a bowl and stir until smooth.    
Mix 1 3/4 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add to the ricotta mixture. Mix until pastry dough comes together. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.    
Beat 1/2 cup sugar and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until thickened. Add sour cream, 2 tablespoons flour, and vanilla extract; stir until filling is well combined.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch springform cake pan.    
Press the chilled pastry into the bottom and sides of the cake pan. Add 1/2 the apples; top with 1/2 of the filling. Repeat layering, ending with the filling.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove and let cool in pan.
