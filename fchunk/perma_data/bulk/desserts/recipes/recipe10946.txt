To Make Filling: Beat cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar and vanilla until soft and smooth.  Add coconut and nuts. Chill.    
To Make Dough:  Beat butter until softened.  Add half of flour.  Then add 1 cup sugar, cocoa, egg, milk, and baking soda.  Beat until combined.  Work in the rest of the flour.  Chill dough until firm enough to roll.    
Place dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper.  With rolling pin roll dough in a rectangle 14 x 6 inches.  Remove top sheet of waxed paper.    
Remove filling from refrigerator and shape into a roll 14 inches long.  Place filling on top of dough.  Start on one end and roll dough around filling (like rolling up a rug) . Moisten and pinch edges together. Cut roll in half.  Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for two days.    
Cut into 1/4 inch slices (using a very sharp knife or waxed dental floss).  Put on greased cookie sheets and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool on sheet for about 1 minute and then finish cooling on racks.
