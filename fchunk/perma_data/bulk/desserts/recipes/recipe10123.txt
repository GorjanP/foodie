Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
Place pie shell on a baking sheet. Whisk eggs until frothy. Stir in pumpkin, corn syrup, sugar, cinnamon, and salt and mix until combined. Pour into pie shell. Carefully transfer filled pie to the oven; sprinkle with pecans.    
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool to room temperature before serving.
