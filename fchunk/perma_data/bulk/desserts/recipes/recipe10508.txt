Preheat pizzelle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl.    
Beat sugar and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Add butter; beat until blended. Add pumpkin puree and vanilla extract; beat until blended. Add flour mixture and mix on medium speed until smooth batter forms.    
Drop a tablespoon of batter onto the preheated iron. Bake until golden, 30 to 40 seconds, or a few seconds longer for darker pizzelle. Remove cookies from the pizzelle press by lifting gently with a fork or spatula; cool on waxed paper.
