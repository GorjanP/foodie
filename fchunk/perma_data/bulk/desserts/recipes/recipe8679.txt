Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut top quarter of pears off; create a well by scooping out the core, being careful not to puncture the bottom of the pear. Arrange pears in a shallow baking dish.    
Drizzle maple syrup over pears. Place 1 tablespoon brown sugar and 1 tablespoon butter in each pear; sprinkle with cinnamon.    
Bake in preheated oven until pears are easily pierced with a fork, 35 to 50 minutes. Serve with ice cream.
