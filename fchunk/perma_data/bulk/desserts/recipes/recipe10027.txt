Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.    
In a large mixing bowl, combine the apples, bread crumbs and sugar. Add currants, nutmeg and cinnamon; mix well. Add the eggs; stir gently to combine. Pour into the prepared casserole dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until solid and golden brown.
