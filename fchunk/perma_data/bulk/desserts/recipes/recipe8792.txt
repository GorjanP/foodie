In a large bowl combine fruit cocktail, mandarin oranges, apples, pears, and pecans.    
In a small mixing bowl, mix cream cheese and lemon juice.  Add enough fruit cocktail juice to achieve a smooth and creamy consistency.    
Fold the cream cheese mixture into the fruit mixture and toss.  Cover and chill for 1 hour before serving.  Prior to serving slice bananas, add to fruit salad and toss again.
