Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x14-inch baking pan.    
Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and dried orange peel in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the orange juice concentrate, water, and orange extract. Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture until well combined, and stir the orange juice mixture in, stirring just enough to thoroughly mix. Gently stir in the cranberries and pecans. Smooth the batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned, about 50 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), cover the dish with foil, and bake until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 30 more minutes.
