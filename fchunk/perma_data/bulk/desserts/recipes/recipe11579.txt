Beat cream in large mixer bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in 1/4 cup Nesquik until stiff peaks form.  Stir in 1 cup Butterfinger pieces.    
Spread about 1 heaping teaspoon whipped cream mixture evenly onto each of 6 graham cracker squares; stack.  Place stack on side on long platter or baking sheet so graham crackers are vertical.  Repeat with remaining graham crackers and whipped cream mixture until 5 stacks are assembled.  Press stacks together to form a loaf.    
Spread remaining whipped cream mixture over top and sides of graham cracker loaf.  Top with remaining Butterfinger pieces.    
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.  To serve, slice diagonally across loaf into 1-inch slices.  Place each slice on plate and top with remaining Nesquik.
