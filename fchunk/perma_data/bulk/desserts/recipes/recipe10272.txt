Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Stir chocolate cake mix, sour cream, vegetable oil, water, and eggs together in a large bowl.    
Pour cake batter evenly into prepared muffin cups.    
Place a small spoonful of whipped cream cheese in each muffin cup.    
Stir strawberry preserves in a bowl until smooth; spoon about 1/4 teaspoon per cupcake over cream cheese.    
Gently press strawberry preserves and cream cheese into the cake batter with a spoon.    
Bake in preheated oven until cupcake tops spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 20 minutes.    
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.    
Spread cream cheese frosting over completely cooled cupcakes and garnish with strawberry slices.
