Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Spread 2 to 3 teaspoons peanut butter onto each of 24 crackers; top each with another cracker to create a "sandwich."    
Arrange "sandwiches" on the prepared baking sheet. Chill in freezer until peanut butter is firm, about 1 hour.    
Heat chocolate and butter together in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 20-second intervals in a microwave oven, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.    
Dip each "sandwich" in the melted chocolate mixture to coat and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Chill coated sandwiches in freezer until chocolate is set, about 1 hour.
