Whisk eggs and sugar together in a large pot. Gradually add milk, whisking constantly. Stir in vanilla.    
Heat milk mixture over low heat, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 30 minutes. Pour into a serving dish and allow to cool.
