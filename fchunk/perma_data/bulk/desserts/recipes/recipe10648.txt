Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Beat marshmallow fluff and strawberry jelly together in a bowl until well-mixed. Cut puff pastry dough into 3-inch pieces.    
Drop marshmallow fluff mixture by the spoonful onto the center of half of the puff pastry pieces; top each with another puff pastry piece and pinch edges to seal. Place sealed pieces onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
