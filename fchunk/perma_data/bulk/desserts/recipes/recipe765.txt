Place chopped tomatoes in a bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt. Let stand 10 minutes. Place in a colander, rinse with cold water and drain.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and beat until creamy.    
Sift together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add raisins and nuts to dry mixture; add dry ingredients to creamed mixture.  Dough will be very stiff. Mix well.    
Add drained tomatoes and mix well.  Pour into the prepared 9 x 13 inch pan.    
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean.
