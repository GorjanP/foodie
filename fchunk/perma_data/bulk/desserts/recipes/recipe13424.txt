Simmer balsamic vinegar in a saucepan over low heat until reduced by half and thickened to a glaze, about 10 minutes. Let cool, about 5 minutes.    
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Arrange nectarine halves cut-side up on a baking sheet; season with black pepper.    
Broil nectarines in the preheated oven until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add blue cheese; continue broiling until blue cheese starts to melt, 1 to 2 minutes more.    
Drizzle balsamic glaze over nectarines.
