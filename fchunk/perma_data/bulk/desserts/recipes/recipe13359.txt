Combine mochiko and sugar in a large microwave-safe bowl. Stir in milk, water, and vanilla extract until smooth.    
Cook in the microwave at 1-minute intervals, stirring after interval, until mochiko mixture turns gelatinous, about 5 minutes.    
Dust a loaf pan with 1 tablespoon kinako; pour in mochiko mixture. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.    
Cut loaf into 16 pieces. Dust pieces with remaining 1 tablespoon kinako.
