Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (8 inch) round pans, OR 1 (9x13 inch) pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in the applesauce. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Stir in the raisins and walnuts. Spread batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes for the 8 inch layers, OR 35 to 40 minutes for the 9x13 inch pan. Test to see if a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before turning out onto cooling racks.
