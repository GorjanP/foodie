In a large bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt until soft peaks form.  Add vanilla, and slowly beat in sugar until very stiff and glossy.  Spread mixture into a 9 inch pie plate to form a shell.    
Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 50 minutes.  Turn oven off, and leave meringue in oven for 1 hour.  Cool.
