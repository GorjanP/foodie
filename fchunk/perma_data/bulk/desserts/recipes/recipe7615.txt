Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 cup confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the cake flour, then fold in the pecans. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 15 to 19 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Cool cookies completely before rolling in  additional confectioners' sugar. If you are storing the cookies in a tin, add remaining sugar to the tin.
