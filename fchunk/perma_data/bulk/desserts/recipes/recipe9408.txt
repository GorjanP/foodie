Whisk heavy cream and sugar together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat until the edges of the cream show fine bubbles but mixture does not boil, allowing sugar to dissolve. Remove from heat.    
Whisk butter, chocolate chips, and Irish cream into cream mixture until butter and chocolate chips are melted. Cool to room temperature.    
Scoop up the chocolate mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time and roll into a 1-inch ball; set truffles on a plate.    
Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
