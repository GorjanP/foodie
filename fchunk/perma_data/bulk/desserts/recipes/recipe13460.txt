Rinse taro chunks in cold water.    
Combine water and sugar in a wok over medium-low heat; stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add taro chunks; cook until soft, syrupy, and reddish in color, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a serving dish.    
Mix coconut cream and salt in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until warmed through but not boiling, about 5 minutes. Drizzle coconut cream over taro.
