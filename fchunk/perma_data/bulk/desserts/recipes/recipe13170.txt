Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix the confectioners' sugar with the egg whites until you get a smooth paste; add the lemon juice, mix and set aside.    
Cut the Bauducco Panettone into small triangles or circles, removing the crust.    
Spread the frosting on one side of the pieces of Panettone, then sprinkle with bits of cashew nuts and bake at 350 degrees F for about 20 minutes or until cookies are golden.
