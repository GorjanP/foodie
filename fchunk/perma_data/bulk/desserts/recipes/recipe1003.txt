Coat a 9 x 13 inch pan with spray oil or margarine.    
In a large saucepan, melt the butter or margarine over low heat.  Add the vanilla.  Melt the marshmallows into the margarine, stirring.  Add the cereal when the marshmallows have melted; stir until cereal is coated.  Quickly pour into the prepared pan.  Use a sheet of waxed paper to press the mixture down flat and evenly into the pan.    
Let set for 2 to 3 hours.  Cut into squares.
