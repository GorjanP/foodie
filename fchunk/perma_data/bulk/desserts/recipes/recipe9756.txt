Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    
Spread the entire can of frosting into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Refrigerate while the filling is prepared. In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar. Stir in the egg, and beat until light. Spread over the frosting. Prepare the cake mix as directed on box, pour over the filling layer, and spread evenly.    
Bake 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate. Wait 5 minutes before removing pan from over the cake.
