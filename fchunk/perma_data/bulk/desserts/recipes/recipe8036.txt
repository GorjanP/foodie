Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one 10 inch tube or bundt pan.    
Mix together the yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding, vegetable oil, cream sherry, eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and poppy seeds, beat at medium speed with an electric mixer for approximately 7 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes.    
Variations: Poppy seeds may not work with these variations: 1) chocolate cake mix with chocolate pudding, 2) white cake mix with pistachio pudding and a dash of green food coloring (nice for St. Patrick's Day or Christmas), 3)  yellow cake mix with lemon pudding, and 4) 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup beer (not everyone's first choice!)
