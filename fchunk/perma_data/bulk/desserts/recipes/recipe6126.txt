Melt chocolate over a double boiler, stirring occasionally until smooth; remove from heat and quickly beat in the egg yolks. Stir in sour cream and set aside.    
In a medium bowl whip egg whites until they start to stand up; add salt and slowly pour in honey until soft peaks form in the mixture.    
Fold egg white mixture into chocolate mixture then spoon into pre-baked pastry shell. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours; serve with whipped topping if desired.
