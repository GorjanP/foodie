Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 28 mini muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.    
Mix pumpkin puree, spice cake mix, and water together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Fill muffin cups 2/3-full with batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 17 minutes.
