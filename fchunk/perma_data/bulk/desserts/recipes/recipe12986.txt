Place sesame seeds in a dish. Roll each log in sesame seeds. Wrap logs in plastic wrap; chill dough in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.    
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.    
Cut dough into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place on the prepared baking sheets.
