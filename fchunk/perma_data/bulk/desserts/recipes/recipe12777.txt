Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Blend cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and oil together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Mix ricotta cheese, sugar, 3 eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Pour evenly over the batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let cool, at least 20 minutes.    
Mix milk and pudding mix together until thickened. Fold in whipped topping and pineapple. Spread over the cooled cake. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours.
