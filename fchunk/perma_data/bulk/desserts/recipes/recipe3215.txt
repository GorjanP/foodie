In a large bowl, stir ricotta cheese with 1 cup confectioners sugar until combined. Add almonds, chocolate chips and almond liqueur.    
Carefully spoon into cannoli shells (or pipe from a pastry bag), filling from the center out.    
Sprinkle individual serving plates with powdered sugar and cocoa, or sprinkle on cannoli. Garnish plates with cherries.    
Note: 1/8 teaspoon almond extract mixed with 1 tablespoon water can be substituted for the almond liqueur.
