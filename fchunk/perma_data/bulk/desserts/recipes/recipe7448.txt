In a medium skillet, melt butter over high heat; add pecans and stir 1 minute to lightly toast nuts. Stir in bananas and molasses; cook 1 minute. Add brandy and cook another 2 to 3 minutes.    
Remove from heat and serve immediately, or pour into covered container and refrigerate. If refrigerated, when ready to serve; bring topping to room temperature or gently warm over low heat.
