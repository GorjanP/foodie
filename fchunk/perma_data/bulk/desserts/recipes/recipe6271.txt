Melt butter and brown sugar together in a skillet over medium-high heat until butter melts and mixture begins to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Place bananas, cut-side down, in brown sugar mixture. Cook until just golden, about 30 seconds; flip and cook until golden on the other side, about 30 seconds.    
Remove from heat. Pour rum and banana liqueur into skillet; return skillet to high heat. Cook until alcohol ignites and flames, 1 to 3 minutes; add cinnamon. When flames die, remove skillet from heat.    
Scoop vanilla ice cream into 2 bowls. Divide bananas mixture between bowls and garnish with mint sprigs.
