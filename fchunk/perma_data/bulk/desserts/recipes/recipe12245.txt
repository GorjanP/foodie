Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.    
Brush a thin layer of chocolate into each muffin cup. Refrigerate cups until chocolate is firm, about 5 minutes. Repeat chocolate layers until cup is thickened, 7 to 10 more times. Chocolate may need to be melted again.    
Carefully peel paper cup off away from the chocolate cups.
