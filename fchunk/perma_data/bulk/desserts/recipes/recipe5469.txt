Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease one 9x9 inch square pan.    
Combine the oats and the sugar. Set aside.    
In a saucepan melt the butter or margarine. Stir in the corn syrup, salt and vanilla. Pour over the oat and sugar mixture, and mix well. Pat into the bottom of the prepared pan.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Do not overbake! It will be bubbly when done. While bars cool melt the chocolate. Spread melted chocolate over bats and sprinkle with nuts. Let cool and cut into bars.
