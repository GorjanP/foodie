Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add water, sugar, vegetable oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract to dry ingredients; mix until batter is just moistened and pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
