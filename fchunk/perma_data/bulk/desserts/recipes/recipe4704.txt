Stir together brownie mix, cocoa and crushed peppermint candies in large bowl. Add contents of syrup pouch, water, egg and oil, beating until well blended. Refrigerate about 1 hour or until firm enough to roll.    
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease. Remove wrappers from candies.    
Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in powdered sugar and place on prepared cookie sheet.
