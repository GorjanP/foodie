Mix together shortening, butter and almonds.  Sift in flour and salt.  Add vanilla.    
Chill dough until firm.    
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).    
Roll dough with hands into 3 inch lengths, pencil thick.  Form into crescents on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake until just slightly brown -- about 16 minutes. Cool on pan    
While still slightly warm, carefully dip in a mixture of confectioner's sugar and  cinnamon.  These are extremely fragile cookies -- handle with care!
