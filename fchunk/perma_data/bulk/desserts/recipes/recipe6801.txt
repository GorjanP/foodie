Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch tube pan.    
Beat vegetable shortening and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until mixture is creamy. Beat eggs into shortening mixture, one at a time, letting each egg blend in before adding the next. Beat in sour cream until smooth.    
Gradually stir cake flour and baking soda into the moist ingredients until batter is smooth; stir in coconut extract. Scoop batter into prepared tube pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean or with moist crumbs, 1 hour and 20 minutes.
