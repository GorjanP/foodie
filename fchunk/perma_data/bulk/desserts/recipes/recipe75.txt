In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended.  Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils.  Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour.    
In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form.  Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.    
In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum.  Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.    
Arrange half of soaked ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish.  Spread half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half of whipped cream over that.  Repeat layers and sprinkle with cocoa.  Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours, until set.
