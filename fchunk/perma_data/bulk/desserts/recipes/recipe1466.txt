Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter or margarine in a 9x13 inch pan and melt in oven while it is preheating.    
In a medium bowl, mix together flour, sugar, and baking powder. Stir in milk.    
Remove pan of melted butter or margarine from oven. Pour mixture into pan, but DO NOT STIR. Spread pie filling onto batter, without stirring.    
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until fruit is bubbly and batter is set and golden brown.
