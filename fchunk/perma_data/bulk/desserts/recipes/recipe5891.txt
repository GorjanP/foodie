In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together the corn syrup and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and  cook until sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat and quickly stir into the peanut butter and vanilla. Pour the mixture into the bowl with the cereal mixture and mix well. Press into the prepared pan. Let stand until set.
