Take ice cream out of freezer to soften. It should be easy to spread and not melted.    
Rip the angel food cake into chunks (about 2 inches). Place a layer of cake on the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch tube pan. Spread a layer of the softened ice cream on top. Repeat layers until cake and ice cream are gone.    
Put cake in freezer for at least 2 to 3 hours. When ready to serve remove cake from freezer and place cake onto a serving dish, removing pan.
