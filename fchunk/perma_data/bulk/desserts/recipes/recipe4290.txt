Rinse strawberries with cool water to clean and then pat dry to absorb excess water. Remove strawberry stems and set aside 12 for later use.    
In a large bowl, combine remaining strawberries, whipped topping, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla and sugar. With an electric mixer, mix on low speed for 5 to 7 minutes or until sugar has dissolved completely and mixture is smooth. Add sour cream and mix 1 minute. Place in refrigerator to chill.    
Toast  pound cake cubes under broiler for approximately 6 minutes, turning once to brown both sides.    
Serve soup in chilled bowls and garnish with whole strawberries, pound cake croutons and fresh mint sprigs.
