Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, mix the white sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. In a separate bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually mix the flour mixture into the sugar mixture. Roll into balls, and arrange 2 to 3 inches apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake 9 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Cool 5 minutes on cookie sheet before transferring to wire racks.
