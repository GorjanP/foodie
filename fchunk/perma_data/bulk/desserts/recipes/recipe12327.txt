Melt suet in a saucepan over medium-low heat; strain liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and discard solids. Refrigerate liquid until again solid.    
Grate solid suet, measure 12 ounces of grated suet into a bowl, and set aside.    
Stir brown sugar, sultana raisins, dark raisins, currants, fruit peel, almonds, allspice, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl; add grated suet and stir. Fold grated apple through the mixture.    
Cover bowl loosely with aluminum foil and allow it to sit at room temperature, stirring once daily, until fermented, 3 to 5 days. Refrigerate until needed.
