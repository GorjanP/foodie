Preheat oven to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C).    
Roll out the pastry for the shell, and fit into a 10 inch pan.  Sprinkle the raisins over the bottom of the crust.    
Combine the egg yolks, egg, sour cream, syrup, sugar, nutmeg, vanilla, and flour in a bowl.  Mix just until blended, not too much.  Pour filling into the shell.  Sprinkle a little more nutmeg on top.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool, and then chill the pie.
