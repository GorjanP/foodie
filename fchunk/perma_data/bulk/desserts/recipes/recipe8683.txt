Mix confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, rice cereal, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using your hands until dough is firm. Roll dough into balls about 3/4 inch in diameter. Arrange on a plate and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.    
Melt chocolate chips and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.    
Place a toothpick into each peanut butter ball; dip 3/4 of each peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate. Return the buckeyes to the plate and refrigerate until chocolate has hardened, 1 hour.
