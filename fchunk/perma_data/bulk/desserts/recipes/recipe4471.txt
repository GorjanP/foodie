Roll pie dough out to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut out circles of dough to fit cups of standard muffin tin. Gently place into muffin cups.    
In a saucepan, melt butter and margarine over low heat just until melted. Stir in brown sugar, coconut, spices, nuts, salt, eggs, lemon juice, and corn syrup.  Mix well.  Fill prepared muffin cups halfway with this mixture.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.
