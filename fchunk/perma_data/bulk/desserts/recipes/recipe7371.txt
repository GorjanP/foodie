Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners.    
Mix cake mix and butter together in a large bowl; add eggs, margarita mix, and egg yolks and stir just until combined. Pour lemon-lime soda into batter and stir until foam is dissolved. Stir tequila into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
