Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Sift together the flour and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Beat in the vanilla and lemon extract. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
