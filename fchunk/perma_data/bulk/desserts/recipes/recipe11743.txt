Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Combine lemon juice, egg whites, lemon extract, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; beat until thick and fluffy. Beat in applesauce, coconut oil, and honey.    
Mix coconut flour, almond flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Turn on mixer; add coconut flour mixture gradually until batter is just combined.    
Scrape batter into the prepared baking pan; press gently with your palm to spread it evenly in the pan. Sprinkle lemon zest evenly on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 50 minutes. Cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes. Invert onto a rack to continue cooling, about 30 minutes. Slice into 12 bars.
