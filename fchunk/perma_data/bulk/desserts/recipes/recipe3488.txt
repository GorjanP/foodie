To Make Pineapple Filling:  Mix 1 cup crushed pineapple and juice (8 1/4-ounce can), 1 cup sugar, 2 1/2 Tablespoons cornstarch, 1 Tablespoon butter, and 1 cup water in saucepan. Cook until thickened, cool.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Cream together shortening and sugar thoroughly.    Stir in flour, baking soda and salt.  Mix in rolled oats.  Press and flatten half of the mixture over bottom of a 13 x 9 1/2 x 2 inch greased pan.  Spread with cooled filling.
