Preheat oven according to box directions for cupcakes. Line cupcake pans with cupcake liners. (Be sure to use liners, and not just the pan.)    
Mix cake according to package directions. Fill cupcake liners slightly less than half full. (You want the cupcake to bake up close to level with the top of the liner.    
Bake according to package directions. Cool completely.    
In chilled medium bowl combine whipping cream and sugar. Beat with an electric mixer on high until stiff peaks form. Refrigerate until ready to use.    
After cupcakes are cooled completely, frost with a level layer of whipped cream frosting.    
Spoon remaining frosting into pastry bag fitted with a star decorating tip. Pipe around the edges of the cupcakes.    
Spoon a small amount of cherry pie filling in the center of each. Refrigerate and enjoy!
