Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the honey, peanut butter and almond butter. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla.    
In a large bowl, toss together the chocolate chips, rice cereal, almonds and rolled oats. Stir in the peanut butter mixture so everything is evenly distributed. Pack tightly into the prepared pan. Refrigerate until set. Cut into bars when cool.
