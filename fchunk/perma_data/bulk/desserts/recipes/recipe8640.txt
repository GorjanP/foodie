Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Stir lemon juice and water together in a bowl; add apples to stop browning process. Whisk 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon together in a separate bowl.    
Beat cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; add egg and vanilla extract and mix until evenly combined.    
Drain apples and transfer to the graham cracker crust. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture and oats over apples. Pour cream cheese mixture over apple mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top is just beginning to brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, 1 to 2 hours. Refrigerate until completely set, 3 to 4 hours.
