Melt the butter in a cast iron pan over the slow, red embers of your campfire.  Pour in marshmallows, and stir until completely melted.  Remove from the fire, and stir in the graham crackers and chocolate.  Press into the pan with the back of a spoon.  Allow to cool completely, then cut into wedges.
