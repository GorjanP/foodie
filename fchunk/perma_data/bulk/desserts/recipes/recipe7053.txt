Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, stir together the butter, molasses, sour cream, brown sugar and vinegar until smooth and well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger and cinnamon; stir into the molasses mixture. Dough will be very stiff when complete.    
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be iced, when cooled, with any standard icing recipe.
