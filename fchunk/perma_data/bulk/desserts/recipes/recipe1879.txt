Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and flour.    
In a large bowl, mix the eggs with a wire whisk. Whisk flour mixture into eggs, until smooth. Stir in buttermilk, margarine, coconut and pecans. Pour into unbaked pie crusts.    
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. If making a 9 inch deep dish pie, bake for 1 hour.
