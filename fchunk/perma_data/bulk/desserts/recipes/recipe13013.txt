Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Combine sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Beat in flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, and allspice. Spread batter into the prepared pan; it will just barely reach the corners.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar on top and cut into squares.
