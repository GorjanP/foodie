Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
To Make Dough:  In a mixing bowl, cream 1 cup butter, 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla.  Combine 2 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt.   Gradually add to the creamed mixture and mix well.    
Shape into 1 inch balls; place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Make a deep indentation in the center of each cookie.    
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges just start to brown.  Remove to wire racks to cool completely.    
To Make Filling:  Beat cream cheese, 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a mixing bowl.  Add pecans and coconut; mix well.    
Spoon 1/2 teaspoon of the filling into each cookie.    
To Make Topping:  Heat chocolate chips, 2 tablespoons butter or margarine and water in a small saucepan until melted. Stir in 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar.  Drizzle over cookies.
