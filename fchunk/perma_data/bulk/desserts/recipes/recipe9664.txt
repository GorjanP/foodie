Cream butter and sugar.  Add yolk and flour.  Cut in fruit and nuts.  Shape dough into two rolls 2 inches in diameter and roll in waxed paper.  Chill overnight.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
While still cold and wax paper still on, take a sharp knife and cut thin slices (1/8 inch).  Set on greased cookie sheets, remove wax paper and bake for 10 minutes.  (Slightly brown edges).
