Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the pie crust pastry evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate.    
Mix the syrup, cream, bread crumbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a bowl; pour into the pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
