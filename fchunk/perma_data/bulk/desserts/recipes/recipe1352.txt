Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening, 1 cup creamy peanut butter and white and brown sugars.  Add vanilla and then eggs, one at a time.  Beat well after each addition.  In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt.  Add slowly to creamy mixture.    
Shape into 1 inch balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet, 2 inches apart.  Flatten balls with a fork.    
Bake for 7-8 minutes depending on size (I tend to keep a close eye on them and remove them as soon as they start to get golden.  This helps to make them chewy.)  Cool on wire racks.    
To Make the filling:  Combine 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and milk in a small bowl adding enough milk to make for a creamy, frosting like texture.  Spread frosting on one cookie and top off to make "sandwich".
