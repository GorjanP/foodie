Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, combine tomato soup, water and baking soda. Add to creamed mixture alternately with the flour mixture. Stir in the raisins and nuts.    
Pour batter into a 10 inch Bundt or tube pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack.
