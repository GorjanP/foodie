In a large bowl, stir together the lemon gelatin mix, lime gelatin mix, and boiling water until gelatin has dissolved. Stir in the apple cider vinegar, cover, and refrigerate for about 1 hour to thicken.    
When the gelatin is thick but not set, stir in the celery, olives, and carrot so they are evenly dispersed throughout. Pour into a 1 quart mold and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours. To serve, unmold onto a plate.
