Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mash together the flour, butter, pecans, and 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar in a bowl until the mixture is thoroughly combined and forms a soft dough. Pinch off about 2 teaspoons of dough per cookie, and roll into 3/4-inch balls. Place the balls on ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms of the cookies are lightly golden brown but the tops are still pale, 8 to 12 minutes.    
Let the cookies cool completely, then roll in remaining confectioners' sugar.
