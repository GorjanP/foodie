Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.    
Lightly brush each peach half with vegetable oil.    
Place peaches cut-side down on the grill; cook until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and continue cooking, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to individual serving bowls.    
Top each peach half with 1 scoop vanilla ice cream and 1 tablespoon graham cracker crumbs before serving.
