Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x4-inch souffle dish or an 8-inch square baking dish.    
Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs and molasses to the butter; beat until smooth. Add figs, lemon zest, buttermilk, and walnuts; beat until incorporated, 1 minute. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg.    
Blend the flour mixture into the batter until combined and pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the pudding cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
