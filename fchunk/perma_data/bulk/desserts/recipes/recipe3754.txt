Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Whisk sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir sugar mixture and pumpkin into eggs until completely incorporated.    
Gradually stir evaporated milk into pumpkin mixture. Add 1 cup yellow cake mix to the pumpkin mixture and stir to remove any lumps. Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle remaining yellow cake mix over the top and drizzle butter over the cake mix.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature and cut into bars. Top with whipped topping.
