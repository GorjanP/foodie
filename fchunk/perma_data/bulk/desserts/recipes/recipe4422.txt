Generously butter baking sheets.    
In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, white sugar, water and butter.  Bring to a rapid boil and stir in pecans.  Continue to cook and stir until large bubbles form on the surface, pecans begin to look sugary and mixture just begins to color.  Remove from heat and drop by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared sheets.  Let cool completely.
