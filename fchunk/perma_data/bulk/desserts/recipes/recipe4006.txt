Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together shortening and peanut butter; gradually add sugar and brown sugar, creaming well. Beat in the egg and vanilla.    
Sift together dry ingredients and add to creamy mixture.    
Shape dough into balls, using a rounded teaspoon for each ball.  Roll balls in sugar and place on a greased cookie sheet.    
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Top each cookie with a candy kiss, pressing down firmly so cookie cracks around edges.    
Put back into oven for 2 to 5 minutes longer, until golden brown.
