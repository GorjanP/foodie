Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, stir together the cake mix and brown sugar. Add egg and milk; mix until well blended. Stir in the butterscotch chips. Spread the dough evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until brownies pull away form the edge of the pan slightly. Cool in the pan on a wire rack then cut into bars.
