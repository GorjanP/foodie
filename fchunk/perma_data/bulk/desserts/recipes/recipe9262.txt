Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
Roll pie pastry onto a cutting board. Cut crust into eight 4-inch circles using a cookie cutter. Place 1 peach slice in the center of each circle. Fold circle in half to enclose each peach slice; seal edges together. Place mini pies on a baking sheet.    
Mix cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle over mini pies.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes.
