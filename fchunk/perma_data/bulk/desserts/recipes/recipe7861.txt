Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spray 24 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.    
Stir yellow cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.    
Spoon cake batter into the prepared mini muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes have risen and are lightly golden brown, 15 to 19 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean. Allow cupcakes to cool for about 20 minutes.    
Whisk instant French vanilla pudding mix and milk together in a bowl for 2 minutes. Allow pudding to stand for 5 more minutes to thicken.    
Pipe the vanilla pudding into each cupcake with about 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla pudding.    
Freeze filled cupcakes for at least 1 hour to make frosting them easier.    
Spread a very thin coating of chocolate frosting over each cupcake; refrigerate cupcakes for 15 minutes.    
Spread second, thicker layer of frosting over the first layer. Place small dollop of whipped cream into center of each frosted cupcake and top with a quarter of a maraschino cherry. Refrigerate mini cupcakes until serving time.
