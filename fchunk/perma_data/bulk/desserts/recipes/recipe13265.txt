Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Combine pound cake mix, pumpkin puree, water, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and baking soda in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Combine brown sugar, walnuts, flour, and butter in a small bowl; mix together with a fork. Spread over batter in the pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
