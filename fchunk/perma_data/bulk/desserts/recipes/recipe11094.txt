In a saucepan, combine the sugar, honey, tahini, and poppy seeds. Stirring constantly, cook the mixture over a low heat until thick, about 30 minutes. Add the nuts and stir well.    
Wet a wooden board and pour the mixture onto it. Pat down the mixture with your hands (careful its hot) or a wet spatula until the candy is about 1/2 inch thick. Let cool. Slice with a wet knife into diamond shape pieces.
