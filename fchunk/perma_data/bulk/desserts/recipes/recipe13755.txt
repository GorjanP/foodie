Place a freezer-safe glass or metal loaf pan in the freezer.    
Combine heavy cream and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in condensed milk.    
Divide mixture among 4 bowls. Add one shade of food coloring to each bowl. Stir until food coloring is thoroughly mixed in.    
Remove the loaf pan from the freezer. Add the colored mixtures a few scoops at a time, alternating colors and layering them over each other, until loaf pan is full. Drag a butter knife through the entire mixture 2 to 3 times to swirl colors together. Top with sprinkles.    
Cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and freeze until ice cream is firm, 5 to 6 hours.
