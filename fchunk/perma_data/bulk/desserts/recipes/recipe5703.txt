Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place the butter, graham crackers, and almonds into a food processor. Cover, and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse crumb. Transfer the crumbs to a 9-inch pie plate, and press into the bottom of the plate to form a crust. Wash and dry the bowl of the food processor; set aside.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool for 15 minutes.    
Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Place the chocolate, tofu, and vanilla extract into the cleaned food processor. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides several times. Pour chocolate mixture into the prepared crust. Chill for 4 hours before serving.
