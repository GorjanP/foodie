Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Whisk 1 cup of flour with the salt in a mixing bowl. Mix in the softened butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Stir in the ice water until a dough forms. Refrigerate until ready to use.    
Place the berries in a mixing bowl, and sprinkle with 1 1/4 cups sugar and 6 tablespoons of flour. Stir in the water until moistened, and scrape into a 2-quart baking dish. Roll the dough on a floured work surface to 1/4-inch thick, and cut into 3/4-inch strips. Place onto the berries in a crisscross pattern. Scatter the diced butter over top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the berries are tender and the crust is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
