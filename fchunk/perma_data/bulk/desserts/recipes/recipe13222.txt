Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix almond butter, brown sugar, shortening, and margarine together in a bowl until creamy. Stir in mashed banana.    
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir into almond butter mixture. Stir in water if dough appears too thick. Fold in dark chocolate.    
Pour white sugar onto a shallow dish. Form dough into 1-inch balls and roll in sugar. Arrange 2 inches apart on baking sheets; flatten with a fork. Top each cookie with an almond.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
