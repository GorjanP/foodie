Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer until well combined. Add egg and baking soda; beat until smooth, 1 minute. Fold in bacon. Form dough into walnut-sized balls.    
Pour 2 tablespoons white sugar into a bowl; roll balls in the sugar until coated. Arrange coated balls on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
