Lay a square of aluminum foil onto a flat surface. Put the banana halves side-by-side in the center of the foil with the cut-sides facing upwards. Arrange chocolate pieces and marshmallows onto one of the banana halves and sandwich between the two halves. Wrap foil around the banana to secure together.    
Place the foil packet directly on the hot coals of your campfire and cook until the chocolate and marshmallow are melted, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Remove packet from fire and let cool a few minutes before serving directly from the foil packet.
