In a small saucepan, cover peeled potatoes with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Let cool and mash.    
Blend together the confectioners' sugar, 3/4 cup mashed potatoes, coconut, and amaretto.  Cover and refrigerate for at least four hours or overnight.    
To Make Frosting:  Using double boiler, mix together the frosting mix, corn syrup, water and butter or margarine.  Stir until butter is melted and mixture becomes smooth.  Remove from heat.    
Form pieces of potato mixture into walnut-sized balls.  Dip in frosting mixture. Set on cookie sheet, unfrosted side down.  Refrigerate at least two hours.
