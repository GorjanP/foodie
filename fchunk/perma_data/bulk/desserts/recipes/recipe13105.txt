Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine Granny Smith apples and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add raisins, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, arrowroot powder, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves; toss to make sure all apple slices are coated.    
Transfer apple mixture to a baking pan. Drizzle 1/4 cup maple syrup on top. Cover with aluminum foil.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apple slices are tender, about 35 minutes.    
Place oats in a food processor. Pulse briefly until crumbly. Pour into a bowl. Sift in coconut flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt.    
Mix olive oil, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Fold into the oat mixture with a fork to make a crumbly topping.    
Toss baked apples. Flatten evenly with the back of a spatula or wooden spoon. Sprinkle topping evenly over the apples. Bake uncovered until top feels crispy, 25 to 30 minutes.
