Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine cream, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons butter, and 3 tablespoons white sugar in a small, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugars dissolve, 2 to 3 minutes. Bring sauce to a simmer, stirring frequently. Cook until slightly thickened, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in whiskey.    
Combine 1 3/4 cups flour, 1/3 cup white sugar, 2 teaspoons orange zest, and salt in a food processor; pulse to briefly combine. Scatter 3/4 cup butter pieces over the flour mixture and process until dough starts clumping together.    
Press dough over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Brush egg white over dough.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 18 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.    
Combine apples, apple juice, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, lemon juice, and apple pie spice in a large skillet. Bring to a boil; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens and looks dry, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Stir in 1 tablespoon orange zest.    
Place 1 1/4 cups flour and 1/3 cup white sugar in a food processor; pulse briefly to combine. Scatter 1/2 cup butter pieces and walnuts over flour mixture. Process until topping mixture starts to clump together. Pour into a bowl. Squeeze topping mixture with your fingertips to form clumps the size of peas.    
Spread cooled filling evenly over dough. Drizzle 1/2 the caramel sauce on top. Sprinkle topping evenly over caramel.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light golden, about 35 minutes. Place pan on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Drizzle remaining caramel sauce on top. Let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Cut into bars.
