Using a double boiler method, melt the chocolate coatings over hot tap water for 15 - 20 minutes. Stir . Do not cook or get water into the chocolate.    
After it is melted, stir in a couple drops of peppermint flavor into the chocolate.    
Dip crackers into the melted chocolate and then place onto a cold cookie sheet and put into the refrigerator to set.  (A freezing tray to rest the dipped cookies will keep the bottoms neat looking.)    
In a few minutes take them out and package in candy cups. The cookies are best kept at room temperature or a cool  dry place away from any odors.
