Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Oil and flour a 9 inch round pan.    
In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine and 1 cup sugar.  Beat in 3 eggs.  Blend in yogurt.  Combine the flour and baking powder; add to the creamed mixture.  Stir in 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  Melt 6 chocolate bars;  blend into the batter.  Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the cake tests done.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the pan.    
Cut a hole in the center of the cake that does not go all the way through the cake.  Melt another 6 sweet chocolate bars, and pour into the hole.    
Beat cream cheese, 3 eggs, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, and 3/4 cup sugar together until smooth.  Pour over the cake.  Bake for 20 minutes.    
Sprinkle confectioners' sugar on the top of the cake.  Return to oven.  Bake until the sugar melts and browns. Serve.
