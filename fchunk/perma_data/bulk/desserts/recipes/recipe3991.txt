Sift flour, baking powder and salt into bowl. Put in butter and lard and mix until resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Stir in sugar and currants or raisins.  Beat the eggs lightly and add to flour mixture with just enough milk to make a firm dough similar to shortcrust pastry.    
Chill dough 1 to 2 hours.    
Roll the dough to 1/4 inch on floured surface and cut with 3 inch rounds. Bake the cakes on a greased  griddle or frying pan (I use my electric skillet with just a little non-stick spray) over low heat until golden brown.  Cool and sprinkle with sugar.    These also freeze well.
