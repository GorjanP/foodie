Pour champagne into a shallow metal pan or bowl, and stir in the sugar.  Cover with plastic wrap, and place in freezer.  Freeze for 4 hours, whisking every 30 minutes.  The frozen mixture will be firm and granular.    
Spoon the sorbet mixture into a blender or food processor, and process until smooth.  Return to the metal container, cover, and re-freeze for up to 48 hours.    
Combine strawberries and blueberries in a small bowl.  Spoon berries into the bottom of champagne flutes or wine glasses, and top with sorbet.  Garnish with mint sprig if desired.
