Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    
In a large mixing bowl cream butter, Truvia(R) Baking Blend, molasses, egg and vanilla until smooth.    
In a second bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.    
Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, mixing until uniform. Stir in the oats and raisins.    
Drop tablespoons of the dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving 2 inches between cookies.    
Bake for 10 minutes or until just golden at the edges.    
Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes, then remove cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
