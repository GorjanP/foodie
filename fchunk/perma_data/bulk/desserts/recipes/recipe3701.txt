Fill the core of the apple with the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Wrap the apple in a large piece of heavy foil, twisting the extra foil into a tail for a handle.  Place the apple in the coals of a campfire or barbeque and let cook 5 to 10 minutes, until softened.  Remove and unwrap, being careful of the hot sugar.
