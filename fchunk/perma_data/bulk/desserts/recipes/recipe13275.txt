Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan with cooking spray.    
Combine yellow cake mix, water, eggs, vegetable oil, and almond extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Spread batter in the prepared pan.    
Stir cranberry sauce with a fork to loosen; spoon half over the cake batter. Swirl with a knife to create a marbled effect.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.    
Mix remaining cranberry sauce and frosting together in a bowl. Spread over the cake.
