Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.    
In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, salt, soda, cocoa, and sugar. Combine eggs, zucchini, oil, and vanilla; blend into dry ingredients. Stir in walnuts.    
Bake for 20 minutes in preheated oven. Cool in the pan, and then cut into bars.
