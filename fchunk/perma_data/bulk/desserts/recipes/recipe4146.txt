Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a small saucepan, melt butterscotch chips and butter over low heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. In a medium bowl, stir together the boiling water and baking soda. Stir in the melted mixture, then stir in the flour, quick oats, sugar and salt. Mix until everything is well blended.    
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto unprepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be very crisp. Remove to cool on wire racks.
