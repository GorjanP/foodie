Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease and flour three 8 inch round pans.    
Sift flour before measuring; resift with salt and baking powder at least twice more.    
Beat egg yolks until very thick and pale - approximately 5 minutes with a mixer on high speed.    
In a large bowl, cream butter or margarine and sugar.  Blend in eggs.  Fold sifted mixture, alternately with milk, into creamed mixture.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until cake springs back when touched.  Cool in pans for 10 minutes.  Turn out, and cool on wire rack.  Frost with Decorator Frosting.
