Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix together the brown sugar, peanut butter, butter, molasses and egg in a large bowl.    
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cloves and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until well blended.    
For each cookie, shape a generous tablespoon of dough into a ball and roll in granulated sugar.  Place the cookies 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or until just set.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
