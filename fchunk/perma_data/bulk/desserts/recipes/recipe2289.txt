Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Mix together the cake mix, melted butter and the egg.  Stir in the chopped pecans.  Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.  Set aside.    
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with the confectioners' sugar.  Beat in the eggs one at a time until blended.    
Pour cream cheese mixture over crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Cool in the pan, then cut into squares before serving.
