Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Toss bread cubes and butter together in a bowl and transfer to an 8-inch square baking pan.    
Whisk milk, pumpkin puree, sugar, egg, egg yolks, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl until well mixed. Pour over the bread mixture. Let soak for 5 to 10 minutes.
