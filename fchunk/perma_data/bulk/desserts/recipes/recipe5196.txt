In a large bowl, beat eggs until fluffy and lemon coloured.  Gradually beat in sugar.  Stir in lemon juice and flavoring.  Add sifted flour mixture gradually while beating; beat only enough to blend.  Add hot milk quickly 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until blended.  Pour into ungreased pan at once.    
Bake 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 55 minutes, or until golden brown and firm to touch.  Invert, and cool in pan.  Then loosen sides, and turn out on cake rack to cool completely.
