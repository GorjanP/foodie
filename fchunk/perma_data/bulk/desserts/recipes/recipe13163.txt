Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.    
Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs. Beat in the flour mixture gradually until just combined. Stir chocolate morsels, caramel morsels, and walnuts into the dough.    
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 11 to 13 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes.
