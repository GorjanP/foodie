Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out pie crust onto a baking sheet.    
Whisk almond paste, egg, and salt together in a bowl until blended. Spread over pie crust, leaving space on the perimeter to fold crust.    
Mix pears and lemon juice in a bowl. Arrange in a decorative pattern on top of almond mixture. Fold outer edges of crust over pears.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, 30 to 50 minutes.    
Place almonds in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Add preserves; cook and stir until saucy, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over the tart.
