Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Mix chopped almonds, 2 cups white sugar, and cocoa powder together in a bowl; add eggs and almond extract and stir until batter is well mixed. Form teaspoonfuls of batter into small balls.    
Place 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl and roll balls in the sugar. Press a finger into the center of each ball, making an indentation. Place 1 almond in each indentation. Arrange cookies 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to crisp, about 15 minutes.
