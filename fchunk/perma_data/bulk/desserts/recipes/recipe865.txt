Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Cover a sided cookie sheet with aluminum foil and line crackers on foil.    
Combine butter and brown sugar in a saucepan.  Stirring constantly, bring to a boil and boil for 3 minutes.  Pour over crackers completely.    
Bake for 5-6 minutes, watch carefully.  Remove cookie sheet from oven, place it on oven door and sprinkle chips over baked crackers.  When chocolate gets soft, spread over crackers with back of a spoon.  Sprinkle slivered almonds on melted chocolate.  Place in refrigerator for at least 8 hours.  Break into cookie-size pieces.  This recipe freezes well.
