Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Combine cake mix, eggs, and oil in a bowl using an electric mixer until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 of the mixture; press remaining mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan to form a crust.    
Combine sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and margarine in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring and checking for completion, about 2 minutes. Pour evenly over the crust. Drop teaspoonfuls of the reserved crust mixture on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
