In a shallow dish, mix together 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside. Heat oil in a deep fryer or electric skillet  to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a separate bowl, mix together 1/3 cup of white sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and cream cheese until smooth. Mix in the vanilla and caramel ice cream topping, then fold in the apples. Lay out the egg roll wrappers on a clean surface. Place 3 tablespoons of filling onto the center of each one. Mix together the cornstarch and water; brush the edges of the egg roll wrappers. Roll up according to package directions.    
Fry the rolls in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove and drain briefly, then roll in the shallow dish of cinnamon sugar while still hot. Serve hot and enjoy.
