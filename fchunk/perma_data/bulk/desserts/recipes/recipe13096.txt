Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, instant coffee, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy.    
Combine flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, salt, baking powder, cream of tartar, and chili powder in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into the butter mixture slowly until blended. Fold in coconut and chocolate chips.    
Drop batter by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring to a rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
