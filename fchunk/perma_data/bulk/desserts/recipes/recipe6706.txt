Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the egg, oil and wine all at once and mix until well blended. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Roll the dough into log shapes and cut into irregularly shaped 1 inch slices. Roll each piece of dough in the egg white and then roll to coat with sesame seeds. Place cookies at least 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Turn the oven off and leave the cookies inside to crisp. These cookies will keep for weeks in an air tight container.
