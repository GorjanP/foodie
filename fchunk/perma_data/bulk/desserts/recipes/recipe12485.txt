Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with coconut oil.    
Place apples in the baking dish. Pour orange juice over apples; mix until well coated.    
Combine pecans, almonds, raisins, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. Spread over the apples.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 35 minutes.
