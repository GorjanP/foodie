Cream together butter or margarine and sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.    
In another bowl, sift flour, salt, and baking powder together.  Blend in to the creamed mixture, and then add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the dough.    
Spread dough in 9 x 13 inch greased baking pan, and sprinkle chopped nuts over top.    
In a small mixing bowl, beat egg white until stiff but not dry.  Add brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the whipped egg white, and beat thoroughly.  Spread meringue over the dough and nuts already in the pan.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes.  Cool, and cut into bars.
