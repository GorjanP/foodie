Melt chocolate and oil together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.    
Place crushed cookies in a shallow bowl.    
Dip strawberries into the melted chocolate. Press coated strawberry in the crushed cookies until completely covered. Place covered strawberries on a plate and refrigerate until chocolate is set, at least 15 minutes.
