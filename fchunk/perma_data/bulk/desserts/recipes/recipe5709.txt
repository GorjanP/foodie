Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl until creamy.    
Beat in eggs and vanilla extract until smooth.    
In a separate bowl, whisk together both amounts of flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Mix flour mixture into the liquid ingredients.    
Gently mix rolled oats, corn flakes, and coconut into the dough until thoroughly combined.    
Drop the dough by tablespoons onto baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.    
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
