Mix 1/4 pound of the butter with 3 cups of flour, 2 tablespoons white sugar, egg yolks, and water.  (Done like making pie dough with a pastry blender.)    
Chill for 1 hour then roll out like pie dough on a floured pastry sheet.  Spread another 1/4 pound of the butter over dough.  Fold dough together and refrigerate 1 hour.  Repeat this procedure until all of the butter is used.    
Cut dough into fourths.  Wrap each quarter in plastic wrap.  Chill.    
Take out one quarter at a time and  allow to stand at room temperature long enough that it softens enough that the dough can be rolled.    
Roll dough out on floured pastry sheet/ board.  Cut dough  into 1/2 inch wide X 4-5 inch long strips.  Wrap around clothes pins or dowel pins pinching ends.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned.  Slide off sticks while still very warm and then cool completely.    
To Make Filling:  In a saucepan over medium heat, cook 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup flour until thick stirring constantly. Let cool.    
Cream together shortening, confectioners' sugar,  marshmallow cream, and vanilla.  Add cooked mixture to creamed mixture and beat till fluffy.  Fill cooled pastry curls with filling.
