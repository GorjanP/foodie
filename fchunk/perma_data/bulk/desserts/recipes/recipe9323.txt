Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Beat cake mix, water, oil, and egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 more minutes. Stir pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice into batter; fold in white chocolate chips. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, leaving about 1/2-inch space at the top. These cupcakes rise quite a bit.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost cupcakes with cream cheese frosting.
