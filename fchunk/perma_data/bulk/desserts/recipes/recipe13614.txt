Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.    
Whisk pumpkin puree, coconut cream, brown sugar, almond milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl to form a smooth batter. Pour batter into baking dish.    
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
