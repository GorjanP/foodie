In a large bowl, cream together shortening and brown sugar. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then mix in milk and the reserved liquid from the raisins. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Stir in oats. Mix in the walnuts and white chocolate chips, if desired. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
