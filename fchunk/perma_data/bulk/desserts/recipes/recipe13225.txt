Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine sugar, flour, and baking soda in a bowl. Add butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir, adding more flour if needed, until batter is thick but smooth.    
Scoop batter onto a nonstick baking sheet using an ice cream scoop.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
