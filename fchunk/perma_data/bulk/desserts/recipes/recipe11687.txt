Chill a large metal bowl in the refrigerator or freezer, about 15 minutes.    
Mix whole berry cranberry sauce and jellied cranberry sauce together in a bowl.    
Place graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin into crumbs.    
Pour heavy cream into the chilled bowl and whip with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and vanilla extract; whip until medium peaks form, about 2 minutes more.    
Place half of the graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of a trifle bowl. Top with half of the cranberry mixture and whipped cream. Repeat layers, ending with whipped cream. Chill until set, at least 3 hours.
