Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Stir muffin mix, milk, and egg together in a large bowl until well combined. Add butter, jalapenos, flour, honey, and onion powder; mix until batter is uniform.    
Portion batter onto the prepared baking sheet using a medium cookie scoop, 1 1/2 inches apart. Sprinkle chile powder over cookies.    
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed, light golden on top, and golden brown underneath, 10 to 12 minutes.
