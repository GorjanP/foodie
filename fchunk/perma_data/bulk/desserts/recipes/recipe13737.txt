Beat brown sugar, shortening, and eggs together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add applesauce and coffee; beat until smooth.    
Mix flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a bowl; add to the wet ingredients and stir until the mixture comes together into a cookie dough.    
Refrigerate dough at least 2 hours to overnight.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.    
Scoop dough by rounded teaspoon onto prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until the cookie tops bounce back when lightly pressed with a fingertip, 9 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on sheets for 10 minute before moving to wire cooling racks to cool completely.
