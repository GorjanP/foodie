Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.    
Mix the flour, sugar, baking soda, walnuts, and cloves together in a large mixing bowl. Beat the egg, applesauce, lemon juice, vanilla, cranberries, lemon zest, and butter together in a separate bowl with an electric hand mixer; pour into the flour mixture and mix well. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with the confectioners' sugar to serve.
