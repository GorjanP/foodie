Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.    
Stir yellow cake mix, 1 1/2 cups eggnog, eggs, 1/4 cup melted butter, and nutmeg together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Pour cupcake batter into prepared muffin cups to fill about 2/3 full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Stir 1 cup eggnog and flour together in a saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely.    
Beat butter, shortening, and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixture until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly beat in cooled eggnog mixture and beat until desired frosting consistency is reached. Spread frosting onto cooled cupcakes.
