Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch pans.    
Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, vegetable oil, and lemon extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is well combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Beat cream in a chilled bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks are almost forming into stiff peaks; place bowl in refrigerator.    
Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture.    
Place 1 cake on a plate; top with blueberry pie filling. Place second cake atop blueberry filling. Generously frost cake with whipped cream cheese frosting.
