Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat 1 1/4 cups sugar, sour cream, eggs and  2 tablespoons flour in a large mixing bowl until smooth.  Stir in vanilla and salt.  Fold in rhubarb.  Pour rhubarb mixture into pie shell.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven.  Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and cinnamon in a small bowl.  Cut in butter with fork or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Set aside.    
Remove pie from oven.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Sprinkle topping mixture evenly over pie.  Return pie to oven and bake until filling is set and crust and topping are golden brown, about 30 minutes.
