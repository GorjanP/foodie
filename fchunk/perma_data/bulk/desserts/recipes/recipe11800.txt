Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a knife; scrape out seeds or use 2 teaspoons vanilla extract if desired.    
In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar and vanilla seeds/extract; stir in flour and almond flour until dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Take small amount of dough and roll into crescent shape; place on parchment paper-lined baking sheet.    
Repeat with remaining dough to make 16 cookies.    
Bake on center rack for about 15 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from oven; let cool completely on baking sheet.    
Meanwhile, scoop Nutella(R) hazelnut spread into a small bowl set over small pan of boiling water; let stand for about 5 minutes or until softened. Dip half of each cookie into Nutella(R) hazelnut spread; let stand for about 20 minutes or until cool.
