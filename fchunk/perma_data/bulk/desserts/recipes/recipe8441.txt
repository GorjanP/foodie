Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in almond extract. Fold in flour until just blended. Spread batter into prepared pan. With the tip of a knife, mark squares in the batter. Spoon equal portions of pie filling in the center of each square.    
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow to cool, then dust with confectioners' sugar.
