Cover the bottom of a large bowl with 1/3 of the angel food cake cubes.  Generously cover the cake with 1 1/3 cups yogurt.  Spread 1 1/3 cups of the strawberry slices and blueberries on top of the yogurt.  Repeat twice with the remaining cake cubes, yogurt, and berries. Serve immediately or chill until needed.
