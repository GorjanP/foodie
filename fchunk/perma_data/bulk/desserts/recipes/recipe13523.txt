Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, vanilla extract, and salt; mix until thoroughly combined. Mix in matzo meal, cocoa powder, and cinnamon with a wooden spoon. Switch to mixer and beat until batter is thoroughly combined and smooth, scraping sides of the bowl, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in chocolate chips.    
Pour batter into the center of the prepared pan; spread out evenly.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan, about 10 minutes. Slice into 18 squares and transfer to a serving plate. Place plate on a wire rack until brownies are thoroughly cooled, about 30 minutes.
