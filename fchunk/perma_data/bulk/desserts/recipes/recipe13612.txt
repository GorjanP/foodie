Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper, set aside.    
Beat butter and sugar until fluffy with an electric mixer. Mix in egg and lemon extract until well blended.    
Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually beat flour mixture into butter mixture until smooth. Divide dough in half; shape into 2 flat disks. Wrap dough in parchment paper; refrigerate 1 hour until firm enough to roll.    
Roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick between two sheets of lightly floured parchment paper.    
Cut dough with 2 to 6-inch snowflake cookie cutters. Place cookies 1-inch apart on parchment-lined cookie sheet. Decorate with colored sprinkles.    
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to brown on edges. Cool.    
Mix powdered sugar and milk together in a small bowl, adding milk slowly until desired consistency is reached. Drizzle over cooled cookies.
