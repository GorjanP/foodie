Combine heavy cream, mascarpone cheese, sugar, espresso, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until firm peaks form.    
Arrange a single layer of chocolate chip cookies in an 8-inch cake pan or springform pan, covering the bottom as much as possible. Spread 1/3 of the whipped cream mixture evenly over the cookies. Place another layer of cookies on top, lying flat and touching, followed by 1/2 of the remaining cream. Repeat with the remaining cookies and cream.    
Smooth the top, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors combine, 4 hours to overnight.
