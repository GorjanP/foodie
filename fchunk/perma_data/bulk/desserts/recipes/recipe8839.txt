Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.    
In a large bowl, stir together custard powder and flour. Cut in butter. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, milk and vanilla extract; mix just until blended.    
Drop dough by spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet to form 12 rounds. Make well in the center with the back of a small spoon, and fill with strawberry jam.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Move to a wire rack to cool.
