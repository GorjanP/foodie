Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 13-inch baking dish    
For topping, combine Sister Schubert Parker House Rolls with all remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Cut butter into ingredients to create a crumble topping.    
For filling, combine apples, sugar, cinnamon, flour, zest and cider and toss well to coat apple slices. Transfer apple mixture to prepared pan. Dot top of apple filling with butter. Cover apples with topping. Bake uncovered 40 to 45 minutes or until topping is light golden brown. Cool slightly and drizzle top of crisp with warm Marzetti Carmel Apple Dip and serve with ice cream.    
Crisp can also be prepared in individual ramekins; baking times may vary depending upon the size of the baking dishes.
