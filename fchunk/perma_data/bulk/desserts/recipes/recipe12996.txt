Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and thin slightly with milk.    
Mix almonds and candied orange peel together in the bowl. Add chocolate and toss with a spatula until evenly coated.    
Spoon mixture into 1 1/2-inch mounds on a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Chill for at least 4 hours before serving.
