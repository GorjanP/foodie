Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and food coloring. Mix in the chocolate hazelnut spread. Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop dough by spoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. These cookies spread.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
