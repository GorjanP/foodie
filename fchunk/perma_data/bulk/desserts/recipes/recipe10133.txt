Crumble the chocolate wafers into a medium-size mixing bowl. Combine the chocolate crumbles with the melted butter or margarine. Press mixture with your hands into a 9 inch pie plate.    
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler. Stir occasionally until smooth. Pour water into the chocolate and continue stirring until blended. Remove the chocolate from the heat.    
Whip the sugar and eggs until thick and pale. Fold the chocolate mixture into the bowl with the sugar and eggs. Fold 1/2 whipped cream into the mixture. Pour mixture into the pie crust. Decorate with remaining cream.
