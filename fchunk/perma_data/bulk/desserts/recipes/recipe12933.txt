Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 10 rose-shaped cake molds with cooking spray.    
Sift flour, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons almond meal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.    
Mix milk, rose water, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.    
Combine 6 tablespoons sugar, egg yolks, and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk mixture, beating batter briefly after each addition.    
Beat egg whites in a separate bowl, with clean beaters, until foamy. Add remaining 7 tablespoons sugar gradually, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold into the batter.    
Spoon batter into the prepared molds.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
