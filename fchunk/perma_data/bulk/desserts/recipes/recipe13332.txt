Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.    
Mix almond flour, grapeseed oil, 3 tablespoons agave syrup, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl. Press evenly into the bottom of the loaf pan to create the crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until pale golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool.    
Process dates into a paste in a food processor. Add hot water and almond butter; process until very smooth. Spread mixture evenly over the crust.    
Whisk cacao powder, coconut oil, and agave syrup together in a bowl. Pour over date layer.    
Refrigerate until cacao layer is firm, 8 hours to overnight. Cut into squares.
