Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch round cake layer pans.    
Sift together into a bowl; cake flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Add the shortening, brown sugar, maple syrup, and 2/3 cup sour cream. Beat for 2 minutes with an electric mixer set at medium speed. Beat in the eggs and 1/3 cup sour cream and mix for another 2 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cake springs back lightly when touched. Cool for 5 minutes, then remove from pans and continue cooling.
