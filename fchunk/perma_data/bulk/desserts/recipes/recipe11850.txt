Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine butter, sweetener, lemon extract, liquid stevia, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs one at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Stir in coconut flour. Let dough rest until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.    
Drop dough onto the prepared baking sheet by rounded spoonfuls, spacing them 2 inches apart. Press almonds into the tops, flattening each cookie slightly.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 minutes.
