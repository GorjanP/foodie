Line a cookie sheet with foil and grease with spray-on cooking oil.    
Pour noodles into a large bowl.  Melt the butter and marshmallows over medium heat, stirring until smooth.  Pour marshmallow mixture over noodles, stirring until well coated.    
Rub some butter on hands and form noodle mixture into six round balls.  Place balls on prepared cookie sheet.  With the back of a teaspoon, press the center of each ball to make a hollow indentation.    
Let nests set until they are firm.  Fill each with small jelly beans. (Other small candies of your choice may be substituted, such as M & M's, small gumdrops, chocolate covered raisins, chocolate covered peanuts, etc.)
