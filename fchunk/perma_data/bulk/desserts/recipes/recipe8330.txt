Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat butter and 1/2 cup white sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; beat in applesauce, brown sugar, and egg until smooth.    
Mix flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, into butter mixture until dough is sandy but shapeable. Roll dough into balls. Pour 3 tablespoons white sugar into a bowl and roll dough balls in the sugar until coated. Flatten dough balls onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are crisp and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a cooling rack and cool for 3 minutes.
