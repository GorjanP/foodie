Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Cream butter or margarine in a bowl, gradually add confectioners' sugar and salt.  Beat until light and fluffy.  Add almonds and vanilla.  Blend in flour gradually and mix well.    
Shape into balls (or crescents) using about 1 teaspoon for each cookie.  Place on ungreased cookie sheets, and bake for 15-20 min.  Do not brown. Cool slightly, then roll in the extra confectioners' sugar.
