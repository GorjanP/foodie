Beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until well blended; stir in corn syrup, egg and vanilla. In a separate bowl,  combine flour, cocoa and baking soda; gradually add this dry mixture to butter mixture. Blend well. Cover and refrigerate dough for 1 hour or until firm enough to handle.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a small bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon.  Shape dough into 1 inch balls; roll each ball in sugar mixture and arrange on a cookie sheet. Using your thumb, make an indentation in center of each cookie.    
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 7 to 8 minutes or until just set.    
Remove the cookies from the oven.  If the indentation has grown indistinct, use the top of a spoon and press indentation in further. Immediately place 1 teaspoon white chips into each indentation.  After several minutes, swirl the melted chips with a spoon.  Top with toffee bits and maraschino cherry halves (if desired).  Cool cookies on a wire rack.
