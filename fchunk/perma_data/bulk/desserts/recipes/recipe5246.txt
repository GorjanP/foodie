Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.    
Place grapefruit halves, cut sides up, onto a baking sheet; sprinkle each with about 1 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar.    
Broil the grapefruit  until the brown sugar has melted and begun to bubble, 3 to 8 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes before eating warm.
