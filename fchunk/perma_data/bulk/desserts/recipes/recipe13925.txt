Place 1 3/4 cups plus 1 1/2 tablespoons milk, white sugar, butter, and lemon zest in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; remove from heat.    
Place bread crumbs in a bowl; add milk mixture. Let cool completely, at least 20 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 338 degrees F (170 degrees C). Butter a baking dish.    
Whisk 3 beaten egg yolks into the milk-bread crumb mixture. Pour half of the custard into the prepared pan.    
Heat jam in a saucepan over medium-low heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Pour half over the pudding in the baking pan. Add the remaining custard; pour the remaining jam on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove pudding from oven; reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Beat 3 egg whites in a bowl until frothy. Add caster sugar gradually, continuing to beat until peaks form. Spread the meringue over the pudding.    
Bake in the hot oven until top is lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
