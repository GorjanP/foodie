Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream the shortening, molasses and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the flour and walnuts. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them about 2 inches apart on an unprepared cookie sheet.    
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Roll cookies in confectioners' sugar when cool.
