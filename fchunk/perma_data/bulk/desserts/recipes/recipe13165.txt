Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.    
Toss bread pieces with 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice in a bowl. Add dried cranberries; toss well. Pour into the prepared pan. Drizzle with melted butter.    
Beat eggs in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, almond milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Beat until thoroughly mixed. Pour over the bread pieces. Let soak, pressing bread lightly with a fork.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back when lightly touched, about 45 minutes.
