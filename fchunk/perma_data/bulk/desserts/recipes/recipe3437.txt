Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. Mix in the rolled oats alternately with the milk. Finally, stir in the raisins. Drop by heaping spoonfuls 3 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 11 minutes, or until edges are golden and tops are dry. Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to cool on wire racks.
