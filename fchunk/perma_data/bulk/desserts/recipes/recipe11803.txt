Custard: Place stainless steel bowl in freezer. Split vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out seeds. In saucepan set over medium heat, combine milk and vanilla seeds; heat until steaming and simmering around edges (do not boil).    
In separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt.    
Slowly pour hot milk mixture into egg yolk mixture, whisking until combined. Return to saucepan; cook, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it is steaming and thickened.    
Transfer to stainless steel bowl from freezer; cover surface directly with plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes or until cooled completely.    
Tiramisu: In bowl, whip together cream, mascarpone and sugar until mixture is stiff. Stir in rum or wine. Gently fold in cooled custard.    
Divide half of the cream mixture among sixteen 1-cup dessert glasses or small bowls.    
Dip ladyfingers into coffee and arrange over top. Top with remaining cream mixture.    
Spoon Nutella(R) hazelnut spread into piping bag fitted with small, plain tip. Pipe about 1/2 tbsp Nutella(R) hazelnut spread over cream to resemble a Christmas tree. Place gold bead on top of each tree.
