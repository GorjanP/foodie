In a large bowl mix together the butter until soft.  Add the peanut butter and sugar and beat well. Mix in the egg and milk. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda.  Add to the egg mixture slowly and mix until just blended. Form dough into 2 logs, and wrap in plastic wrap. Freeze for at least 2 hours.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.    
Chop chocolate into small pieces and place in the top of a double boiler over medium heat.  Stir frequently until melted.  Add butter or margarine and stir until melted. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.    
Remove one package of the dough from the freezer and unwrap.  With a sharp, serrated knife, cut a few slices of the dough 1/4 inch thick and place on cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.    
Quickly spoon a teaspoonful of the chocolate on each slice.  Cut more slices, and top each with another slice of dough. If dough becomes too soft, rewrap it and return to freezer.  Reheat chocolate if it becomes too hard.    
Bake 10 to 12 minutes until lightly colored.
