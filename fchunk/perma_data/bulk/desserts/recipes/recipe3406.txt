Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.    
Stir yellow cake mix, eggs, water, and vegetable oil in a bowl until moistened; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in crushed pineapple. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean or with moist crumbs, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove cake from oven.    
Whisk cream of coconut with milk in a bowl until smooth; pour mixture over hot cake. Allow cake to cool thoroughly.    
Whip cream in a mixing bowl with sugar, using an electric mixer, until whipped cream holds soft peaks. Frost top of cake with whipped cream and sprinkle with toasted coconut.
