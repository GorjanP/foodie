Allow butter to reach room temperature. Cream sugar and butter together until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time and mix well.  Add in flour, powdered milk, and corn syrup.  Beat each in well.  Add juice of half a lemon, salt, vanilla, nutmeg and mace.  Make sure everything is well blended, and pour into a greased loaf pan.    
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 45 minutes, checking for doneness by inserting a toothpick and seeing if it comes out clean.  You almost want to underbake this.
