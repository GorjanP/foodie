In a large bowl, mix flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and cream of tartar.  Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives.  Stir in cream and egg.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 2 minutes.  Press into a half-inch thick sheet.  Cut into squares.  Place on baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, or until golden.  Sprinkle 3 tablespoons sugar over sliced berries.    
Let shortcakes cool before splitting and filling with sugared berries.
