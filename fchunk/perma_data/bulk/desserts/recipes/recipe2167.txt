Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs, water and egg whites. Beat for 2 minutes at high speed of an electric mixer.    
Divide batter evenly among paper lined cups, filling about 2/3 full.  Place a chocolate kiss in each cupcake, pressing in lightly.  Spoon 1 teaspoon graham cracker crumbs onto each cupcake.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 18 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and top each cupcake with 1 teaspoon marshmallow creme. Dip spoon into hot water to prevent sticking. Return to oven for about 1 minute to melt slightly.
