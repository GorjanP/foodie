In a small bowl, sift 2 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together and set aside.    
Blend shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Mix in the flour mixture.  Add 3/4 cup milk; beat for 2 minutes.  Add egg whites, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup milk.  Beat well.    
Grease and flour two 9 inch round pans.  Pour the batter into the pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes.  Cool cake layers on a wire rack.    
Remove the meat from the coconut and shred it.    
To Make Frosting:  Moisten 1 tablespoon flour with a small amount of water to make a paste.  Combine 1 cup milk, coconut milk, 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and shredded coconut in a saucepan.  Mix in flour paste, and cook for 10 minutes.  Cool the frosting, and spread over cake.
