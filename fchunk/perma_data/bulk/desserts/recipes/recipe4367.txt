Prepare cake according to package directions and bake in a 9x13 inch pan.  Let cool completely.  Cut half the cake into 1-inch cubes (saving the other half for another dessert).    
In a large bowl, beat together pudding mix and milk until thick and creamy.  Beat in cream cheese until fluffy.  Fold in half the whipped topping.    
In a large punch or trifle bowl, layer one-third of the cake cubes, one-third of the cream cheese mixture, one-third of the banana slices and one-third of the pecans.  Top with one-third of the fudge sauce.    
Repeat cake and cream cheese layers and top with half the cherry pie filling.  Cover the pie filling with one-third of the bananas, one-third of the pecans and one-third of the fudge sauce.    
Repeat step 4, omitting the pecan layer.  Top with remaining whipped topping; drizzle with remaining fudge sauce; and sprinkle with remaining pecans.  Refrigerate 4 hours before serving.
