Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.  With a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in currants.    
Mix in beaten egg.  Pour in milk and mix with a fork to make a soft dough (may need a little more milk).    
On a floured surface, shape dough into a ball and knead lightly 5 or 6 times.   Roll out dough  to 1/4 inch thick and cut into squares and triangles with a knife (approximately 2 inches in diameter).    
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until slightly browned.
