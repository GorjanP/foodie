Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x4-inch loaf pan.  Sift together flour and baking powder.    
In a large mixing bowl, cream the sugar and butter. Beat in the egg yolks.  Beat in flour mixture.  Stir in the vanilla and lemon extracts.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour.
