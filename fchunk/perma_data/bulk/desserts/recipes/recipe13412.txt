Combine dates and walnuts in a food processor; pulse until a loose dough forms. Mix in wheat cereal biscuits until a pliable dough forms.    
Grease a muffin tin lightly with cooking spray. Line muffin cups with strips of parchment paper.    
Drop 1 tablespoon of dough into each muffin cup; press over the bottom with your fingers. Freeze until firm, 10 to 15 minutes.    
Combine soaked cashews, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut milk, maple syrup, coconut oil, and lemon juice in a blender; blend until smooth.    
Divide cashew mixture evenly among muffin cups. Tap muffin tin against a work surface to release any air bubbles in the cashew mixture. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until firm, 4 to 6 hours.    
Pull cheesecakes out of muffin cups using the parchment paper ends. Drizzle caramel sauce and peanut butter on top; garnish with blueberries.
