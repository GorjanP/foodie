Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Set aside.    
Unwrap caramels and place in saucepan with 2 Tablespoons evaporated milk. Melt over medium to low heat, stirring constantly.    
In a large bowl, combine the remaining evaporated milk, dry cake mix, and melted butter.  Stir until well blended.  Spread half of this mixture in the prepared pan.  Bake for 10 minutes.    
Remove brownies from oven.  Sprinkle chocolate chips and drizzle melted caramels over the top.   Drop remaining cake mixture by teaspoonfuls over all.  Return to oven for 20 minutes. Garnish with whole pecans if you'd like.
