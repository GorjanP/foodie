Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the strawberry spread, margarine, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then stir in the olive oil. Combine the flour, baking soda and cinnamon; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the oats until well blended. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops are lightly browned. Let cookies stand for 1 minute on the baking sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
