Melt 9 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over low heat; mix in oats. Remove from heat and let cool, about 20 minutes.    
Mix eggs, sugar, vanilla sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl; stir in dates-oat mixture.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with remaining 1 tablespoon butter.    
Use 2 teaspoons to place little mounds of oat-date mixture 2 inches apart onto the baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the top and bottom, about 20 minutes.
