Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.  In a medium bowl, combine the apples, 5 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon.  Set aside.    
Sift together the flour and baking powder; set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the eggs and sugar.  Stir in the oil, vanilla and orange juice, mixing until blended.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the orange juice mixture.  Stir just until combined.    
Layer batter and apple mixture in the prepared pan, beginning and ending with the batter. Bake in the preheated oven for 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
