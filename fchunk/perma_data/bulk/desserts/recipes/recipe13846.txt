Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Combine flour, 3/4 cup coconut oil, and cream cheese together in a bowl; form into 36 balls. Press each ball into the cup of a miniature muffin tin, creating small crusts.    
Melt 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a saucepan over low heat. Add pecans, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract; stir until filling is evenly combined. Fill each crust 3/4-full with filling.    
Bake in the preheated oven until filling puffs up, about 12 minutes.
