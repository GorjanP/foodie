Place a large metal bowl and beaters from an electric mixer in the freezer.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan with cooking spray.    
Mix crushed graham crackers, butter, white sugar, shortening, and cinnamon in a bowl until well blended. Press into the prepared pan to make crust.    
Bake crust in the preheated oven until set, about 7 minutes. Let cool, about 5 minutes. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Transfer to the freezer and chill until cool to the touch.    
Beat heavy cream in chilled bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Beat in confectioners' sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Add vanilla extract; continue to beat until stiff peaks form.    
Arrange 1 layer of strawberries over chilled crust. Add 1 layer of whipped cream. Repeat with a second layer of strawberries and whipped cream. Top with remaining strawberries. Drizzle strawberry syrup on top.    
Refrigerate pie until set, about 1 hour. Cut into 9 pieces before serving.
