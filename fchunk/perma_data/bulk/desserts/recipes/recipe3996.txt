Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and  baking soda; set aside. In a large bowl beat the eggs, oil and sugar together until smooth.  Stir in the pumpkin, then the dry ingredients. Finally, stir in the raisins.    
Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow bars to cool before adding the glaze.    
To make the glaze, stir together the confectioners' sugar with the maple syrup. If glaze is too thick to drizzle from a spoon, just add a little water. Drizzle over the cooled  pumpkin bars before cutting. Individual bars can be decorated with a candy corn or candy pumpkin.
