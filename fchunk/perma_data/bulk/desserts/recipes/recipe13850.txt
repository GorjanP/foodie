Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk, lemon peel, and lemon extract and beat well.    
Sift flour and salt together in a bowl. Add to the bowl with the butter mixture in 3 additions, mixing well after each. Add food coloring and mix in thoroughly.    
Press cookies 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheet using a cookie press fitted with a flower disc. Press 1 red hot cinnamon candy into the center of each cookie.    
Bake in the preheated oven until just starting to turn golden brown on the edges, 14 to 16 minutes; do not overbake.    
Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
