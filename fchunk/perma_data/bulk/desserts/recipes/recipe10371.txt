Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Mix flour, oats, butter, brown sugar, and graham cracker crumbs together in a bowl; spread mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle half the oat mixture into a 9x13-baking dish; gently pat into dish. Drizzle half the chocolate sauce over oat layer.    
Arrange vanilla ice cream slices over chocolate layer; sprinkle the remaining oat mixture over ice cream layer. Drizzle the remaining ice cream sauce over cake. Cover dish with aluminum foil and freeze until set, at least 5 hours.
