Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl to form a dough.    
Combine confectioners' sugar and sprinkles together in a small bowl.    
Shape dough into 1-inch balls and roll each in the confectioners' sugar mixture. Arrange cookie balls on baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden, about 6 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets, about 5 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
