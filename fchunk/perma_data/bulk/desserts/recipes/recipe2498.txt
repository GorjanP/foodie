Line a jelly roll pan with waxed paper and set aside.    
Melt the white confectioners' coating in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Spread the melted white confectioners' coating onto the prepared pan. Sprinkle the jellybeans over the top.    
Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Break into pieces to serve.
