Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix flour, raisins, hemp seed hearts, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar, white sugar, butter, and applesauce together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add peanut butter and beat until smooth.    
Beat eggs and vanilla extract together in a bowl; stir into peanut butter mixture. Mix flour mixture into peanut butter mixture until a smooth dough forms. Roll dough into small balls and place on a baking sheet; press each with a fork to flatten.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 9 minutes.
