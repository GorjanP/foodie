Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dust 2 baking sheets with flour.    
Combine brown sugar and butter together in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, cinnamon, baking powder, cloves, and nutmeg. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together.    
Shape dough into cookies by hand or using cookie cutters. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until firm but not hard, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
