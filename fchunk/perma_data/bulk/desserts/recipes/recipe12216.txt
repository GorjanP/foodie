Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.    
Mix cake mix and pudding mix together in a bowl. Add sour cream, melted butter, eggs, butter-flavored extract, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and coconut extract to cake mix mixture and stir until batter is thoroughly mixed. Fold butterscotch chips and toffee baking bits into batter. Fill the prepared pan 2/3-full with batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing cake from pan to cool completely.    
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add pecans, corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to melted butter; cook and stir until mixture is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in frosting; pour over cooled cake.
