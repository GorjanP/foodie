Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Combine peaches, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2-quart baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.    
Meanwhile, combine flour, white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water until just combined.    
Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of flour mixture over them.    
Mix together 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.  Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.
