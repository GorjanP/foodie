Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add squash, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Transfer squash to a bowl and mash with a fork or potato masher until smooth.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Combine sugar, milk, egg, butter, and lemon extract in a large bowl. Gradually sift flour into milk mixture. Fold mashed squash into milk mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until air bubbles form on the surface and pudding is golden brown, about 1 hour. Chill in the refrigerator until firm; cut into bars.
