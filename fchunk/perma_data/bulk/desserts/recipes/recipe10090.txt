Beat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix cream cheese and vanilla into creamed butter until smooth; stir in confectioners' sugar until incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until mixture is firm, about 2 hours.    
Roll sugar mixture into small egg-shapes; arrange on a baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours more.    
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.    
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Dip eggs into melted chocolate using a fork or wooden skewer until evenly coated.    
Arrange dipped eggs on the prepared baking sheet; garnish with sprinkles. Allow chocolate to harden, about 30 minutes. Place eggs in paper muffin or candy cups and store in refrigerator.
