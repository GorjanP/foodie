Beat eggs, egg whites, and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Stir in cinnamon and cloves. Blend in mashed banana; mix in matzo meal. Let batter stand until thickened, about 5 minutes.    
Grease a griddle with cooking spray and preheat over medium heat. Drop silver dollar-sized dollops of batter onto the griddle. Cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
