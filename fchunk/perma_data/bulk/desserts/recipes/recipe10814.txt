Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a bowl. Mix until evenly moistened; press into the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to brown and smell toasted, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely, about 1 hour.    
Combine milk and pudding mix in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add ice cream and strawberries in syrup and stir until completely combined. Pour over cooled crust.    
Freeze until firm, at least 3 hours.  Remove from the freezer 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
