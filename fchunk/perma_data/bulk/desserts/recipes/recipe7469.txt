In a bowl, cream the butter or margarine with the sugar.  Beat in the milk, applesauce, and 2 tablespoons of rum.    
In another bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, spices, and salt.  Beat into the creamed mixture and then stir in the raisins and pecans.    
Turn the batter into a greased and floured 9x13 inch baking pan.  Bake the cake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 45 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick.    
Immediately after removing the cake from the oven, sprinkle it with the remaining 1/4 cup rum.  Let cool on a rack.  This cake improves if allowed to sit for a day or so before eating.  Serves 20.
