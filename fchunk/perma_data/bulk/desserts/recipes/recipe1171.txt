Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).    
Mix butter in a mixer until light, add remaining ingredients.    
Knead until velvety.  Roll one-half of the dough at a time to about 1/4 inch thickness using the smallest amount of flour possible.    
Cut out and bake on a lightly greased pan for 12 minutes. Cookies will be almost white when cooked.
