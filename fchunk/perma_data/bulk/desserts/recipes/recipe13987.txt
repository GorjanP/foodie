Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Toast walnuts in a skillet until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Chop coarsely.    
Stir rye flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Mix walnuts, oats, figs, and chocolate chips in a separate bowl.    
Beat butter in a stand mixer until light and fluffy. Add brown sugar; beat to incorporate. Add egg and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth. Add flour and oat mixtures to the bowl. Mix on low speed until thoroughly incorporated.    
Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls and arrange on the baking sheet about 2 1/2 inches apart. Press down with the back of a large spoon to flatten cookies.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, about 16 minutes. Remove from baking sheets and cool on a rack.
