Chop the coconut meat into pieces about 1/2 inch square.    
Place water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in cinnamon and sugar until dissolved. Boil mixture until liquid reduces to a syrup consistency, then stir in coconut pieces. Add the lime juice, and turn off heat.    
Place spoonfuls of sugared coconut mixture into small paper cups. Cool in cups until hardened.
