Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Dissolve the baking soda in the water.    
Combine the oats, flour and brown sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the baking soda mixture and form dough into a ball. Either roll dough out to 1/4 inch thick and cut with cookie cutters or press dough into the bottom of one 9x13 inch baking pan.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.
