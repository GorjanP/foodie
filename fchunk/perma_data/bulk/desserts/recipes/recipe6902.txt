Line baking sheets with waxed paper. Mix the oats, coconut, and peanut butter in a  bowl until thoroughly combined.    
Place sugar, cocoa powder, butter, and milk in a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir until the mixture is smooth and the sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute; remove from heat. Mix the oat mixture into the liquid mixture; stir in vanilla extract.    
Scoop up about 1 tablespoonful of the dough, roll it into a ball, and flatten. Place on waxed paper, and allow to cool.
