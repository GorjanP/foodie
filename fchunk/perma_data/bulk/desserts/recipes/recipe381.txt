Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl. Add egg and vanilla and beat well.  Add the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder and stir until smooth. Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls about the size of a walnut (larger if desired).  Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Press center of each ball with thumb.    
Drain cherries and reserve juice. Place a cherry in indentation of each cookie ball.    
In a saucepan, heat condensed milk and chocolate chips until chips are melted.  Stir in 4 teaspoons of cherry juice.  Spoon about 1 teaspoon of mixture over each cherry and spread to cover cherry.  (More  cherry juice may be added to keep frosting of spreading consistency.)    
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
