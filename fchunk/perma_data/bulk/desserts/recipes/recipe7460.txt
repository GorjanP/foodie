Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8x8 inch pan.    
In a medium bowl, mix cheese and sugar until soft. Add eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly with each addition. Add vanilla and mix to incorporate.    
Pour into prepared 8x8 inch pan. If desired, sprinkle top lightly with cinnamon. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cake will appear to be soft in the center. Allow to cool and it will set.
