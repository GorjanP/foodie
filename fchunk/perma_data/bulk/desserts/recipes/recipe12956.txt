Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.    
Mix bananas, oil, and eggs in a bowl until fully combined. Add cake mix and blend thoroughly using an electric mixer. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.    
Let cake cool completely, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
