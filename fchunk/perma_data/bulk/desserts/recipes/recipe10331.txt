Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F).  Grease 2 baking sheets.    
In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, and baking powder.  Cut in the vegetable shortening  until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.    
In a large bowl, beat the eggs until thick and light-colored.  Gradually beat the eggs into the flour mixture.  Fold in the walnuts.    
On a floured surface, roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick.  Using a cookie cutter, cut into desired shapes and place 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.    
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until lightly colored.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.
