Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.    
Beat shortening and sugar together. Blend eggs and fruit into the shortening and sugar mixture. Stir flour, salt, baking soda and nuts into the egg mixture; mix well.    
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto the greased cookie sheet. The cookies will double in size while baking, so set the cookies far apart on the cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes.
