Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Mix together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.    
In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar and oil. Beat until smooth. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the baby food. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool. Cut into bars.
