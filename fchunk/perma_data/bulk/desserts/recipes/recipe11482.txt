Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place zucchini in a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Blend in a blender until smooth. Measure 2 cups blended zucchini; pour into a large bowl.    
Whisk milk, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg together with blended zucchini until smooth. Pour into pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center of pie is set and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes.
