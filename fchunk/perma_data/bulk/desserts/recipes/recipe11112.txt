Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or grease lightly.    
In a medium bowl, blend together the sugar and almond paste using your fingers until the paste is completely worked into the sugar. Stir in the coconut and chocolate chips. In a clean dry glass or metal bowl, Whip egg whites and cream of tartar to stiff peaks. Fold half of the egg whites into the coconut mixture to lighten the batter. Gently fold in the remaining whites, being careful not to deflate. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tops are lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
