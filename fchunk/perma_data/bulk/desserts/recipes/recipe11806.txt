Toss apples with lemon juice. Arrange on a serving platter or shallow serving dish.    
In a small bowl combine 1 cup HERSHEY'S Cookies 'N' Creme Baking Pieces and shortening (do not use butter, margarine, spread or oil). Microwave at MEDIUM (50%) 30 seconds; stir. Microwave at MEDIUM an additional 10 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, until chips are melted and smooth when stirred (the cookie pieces will not melt).    
Drizzle melted chips over apples on the platter. Sprinkle with remaining HERSHEY'S Cookies 'N' Creme Baking Pieces, peanuts, and sprinkles. Garnish with whipped cream and add a cherry, if desired. Drizzle with HERSHEY'S Strawberry Flavored Syrup if desired, and serve immediately.
