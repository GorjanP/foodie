Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.    
Beat 3 eggs in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the hot skillet. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until scrambled and set, about 5 minutes.    
Preheat a cake pop maker according to manufacturer's instructions.    
Combine remaining egg, baking mix, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl to make pancake batter.    
Fold crumbled bacon, scrambled eggs, and Cheddar cheese gently into the batter.
