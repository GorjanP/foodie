Reserve 1/4 cup strawberries for garnishing; leave them halved or slice to your preference. Slice the remaining 7 3/4 cups strawberries; place in a bowl with white sugar and 1 tablespoon almond extract. Stir to combine.    
Pour heavy whipping cream into a bowl; beat until stiff peaks form.    
Mix cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, sour cream, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract into the whipped cream. Fold cake cubes gently into the cream mixture.    
Cover the bottom of a trifle bowl with a shallow layer of the strawberry-sugar mixture; follow with a layer of the cream mixture. Continue layering until bowl is full; top with reserved strawberries. Chill for 2 hours.
