Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place pretzels on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.    
Place an unwrapped chocolate piece onto each pretzel.    
Heat the pretzels and chocolate candies in the preheated oven until the milk chocolate pieces become soft but hold their shape, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch carefully and don't let the chocolate melt to the point of dripping.    
Remove the pretzels from the oven and allow to stand for 1 minute to allow candy to finish softening.    
Push a colored candy-coated piece into the center of each chocolate kiss, pushing it down and flattening it. Set treats aside to cool to room temperature and fully set, about 30 minutes.
