Place the strawberries and water in a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth. Pour into a small saucepan. Stir in tapioca, and let stand for 10 minutes to soften. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Remove from heat when thick, and pour into serving dishes.
