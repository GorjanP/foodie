For spider cupcakes: Frost 4 cupcakes with a thin layer of chocolate frosting. Cut each licorice strip into 3 pieces. Poke 6 holes around the sides of each cupcake with a skewer. Insert 1 licorice piece into each hole for the spider legs. Place 2 candy-coated milk chocolate pieces as eyes and one for the nose. Add drops of icing to the eyes to make pupils.    
For worm cupcakes: Frost 4 cupcakes with a thin layer of chocolate frosting. Sprinkle cookie crumbs on top to resemble dirt. Cut gummy worms in half and brush the cut side with some frosting. Stick onto the cupcakes on either side.    
For graveyard cupcakes: Frost 4 cupcakes with a thin layer of chocolate frosting. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip with remaining chocolate frosting. Write "RIP" or draw a cross on each sandwich cookie. Insert decorated cookies into the cupcake so that they look like tombstones. Sprinkle chocolate cookie crumbs around the cookie tombstones to resemble dirt.
