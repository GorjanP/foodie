Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a heavy saucepan over low heat, stir chocolate chips and butter until melted and smooth. Stir in condensed milk, flour and vanilla until well blended.    
Shape one level teaspoon of chocolate chip dough around each candy kiss.  Arrange bonbons one inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake 6 minutes. Bonbons will be soft and shiny, but will firm up as they cool.
