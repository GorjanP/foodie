Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
To Make Dough: Combine flour and salt in food processor, then add 3/4 cup of butter and process until blended. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time pulsing only until dough forms a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes, or up to 1 day if time allows.    
To Make Filling: In a large bowl, cream together remaining 1/4 cup butter and brown sugar. Stir in chopped apples.    
Roll out dough into a rectangle approximately 12x18 inches in size. Spread filling onto dough, then roll dough up starting at longest side. Cut into 2 inch pieces and place each dumpling into baking dish. Brush top of dough with egg white and sprinkle with sugar.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until dough is brown. Let set for 15 minutes.
