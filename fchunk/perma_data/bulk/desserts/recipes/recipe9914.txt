Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Place cookie dough slices about 1 1/2 inch apart on prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are light gold, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a rack.    
When the cookies are cool, spread tops with marshmallow creme. Sprinkle evenly with chocolate chips and graham cracker crumbs.
