In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the peanut butter, corn syrup, brown sugar and white sugar. Cook stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and quickly mix in the corn flakes, chocolate chips and peanuts until evenly coated.    
Press the entire mixture gently into a buttered 9x13 inch baking dish. Allow to cool completely before cutting into bars.
