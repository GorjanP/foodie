Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Beat milk, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and lemon extract into the dry ingredients using an electric mixer set to medium for 2 minutes.    
Bring lemon juice to a boil in a small saucepan and immediately beat into the batter with the electric mixer on low speed.    
Fill cupcake liners with batter to about two-thirds full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
