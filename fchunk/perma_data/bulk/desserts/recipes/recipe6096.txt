Melt margarine in 2 quart saucepan.  Add sugar, and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Stir in  water and the corn syrup.  Cook over medium heat, stirring often, to 270 degrees F (132 degrees C).    
Remove from heat, and quickly stir in coarse nuts.  Spread on to prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle chocolate over hot candy; when it begins to melt, spread evenly over the top. Top with nuts. Refrigerate until firm. Break into small pieces to serve.
