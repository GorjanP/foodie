Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a 9x5 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, white sugar and flour. Stir in melted butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add vanilla extract. Mix in baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and ginger. Reserve 1/4 cup this mixture to be used as topping.    
In a separate bowl, beat together egg and buttermilk; stir slowly into flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle batter with reserved topping.    
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the cake comes out clean. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.
