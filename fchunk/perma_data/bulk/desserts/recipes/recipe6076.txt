In a medium bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Mix in the eggs. Stir together the flour and baking powder. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until blended. Stir in milk and vanilla. Cover and chill dough for 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Roll dough into 1 inch balls, place 1 to 2 inches apart on an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove to cool on wire racks.
