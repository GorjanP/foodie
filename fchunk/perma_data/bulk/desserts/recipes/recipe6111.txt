In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.    
In the top of a double boiler over simmering water, combine 1 1/2 cups cooked rice, milk, sugar, vanilla, raisins, butter and cocoa.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.
