Combine flour, baking powder, spices and salt.    
In a large bowl, beat the sugar and eggs until thick and light-colored.  Beat in the lemon juice.  Beat in the lemon zest.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.  Stir in the hazelnuts.  Cover and chill for 4 hours.    
On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/2 inch.  Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out cookies and place 1 inch apart on lightly greased baking sheets.   Cover the baking sheets with clean towels and leave undisturbed for 4 hours.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Turn the cookies over and place a drop of brandy in the center of each cookie.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly colored.  Transfer to wire racks  to cool.
