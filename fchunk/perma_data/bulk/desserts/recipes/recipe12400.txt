Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl; pour flour mixture into a 4-cup glass jar. Layer brown sugar and superfine sugar in the jar, pressing firmly between each layer. Layer oats, cranberries, and chocolate chips. Seal jar.    
To make cookies: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Empty dry cookie mix in large bowl. Stir in butter, egg, and vanilla extract until combined. Roll the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on the sheets for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
