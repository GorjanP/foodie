Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Pour the butter into a 9x13 inch baking dish, then sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs on top, pressing down to form a crust. Sprinkle evenly with the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and shredded coconut. Drizzle the milk overtop, then sprinkle with the chopped walnuts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the condensed milk has thickened and turned brown, and the walnuts have browned, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack and cut into squares to serve.
