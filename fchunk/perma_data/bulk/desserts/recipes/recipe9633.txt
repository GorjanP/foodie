Cream 1 1/2 c sugar with the eggs.  Add fruit cocktail (including liquid).  Add the flour and baking soda--mixing well with beater.  Pour into a greased and floured 9 inch round cake pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) about 15-20 minutes.  Usually bakes best in thick aluminum cake pans.    
To Make Frosting: Mix well the cup of sugar, canned milk and stick of margarine.  Cook slowly till mixture blends.  Cook about 2 minutes more; remove from heat. Add vanilla, chopped nuts and coconut. Stir mixture until thick. Spread on cake.
