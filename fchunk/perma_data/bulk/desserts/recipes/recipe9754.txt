Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 x15 inch jellyroll pan.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the flour. Finally, stir in the chocolate syrup until well blended. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven. While the cake is baking, you should prepare the icing.    
In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, evaporated milk, and butter. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate chips until mixture is smooth and chips are melted. When the cake comes out of the oven pour the hot icing over the hot cake. Sprinkle the nuts over the top. When cake is cool, cut into 2 inch squares.
