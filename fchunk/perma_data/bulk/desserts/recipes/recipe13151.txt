Combine dates, 1/3 cup almonds, coconut, pumpkin puree, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a food processor. Blend until well combined. Roll spoonfuls of mixture into balls between your palms; place on a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet.    
Place remaining 1/3 cup almonds on a plate. Roll balls in the almonds until coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour.
