Grease one 2-quart lidded pudding mold.  Sift together the flour, sugar and cinnamon; set aside.    
In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, butter, mincemeat, cranberry sauce and pumpkin. Add to flour mixture and mix until smooth; pour into pudding mold.    
Place a rack in the bottom of a large pot, over medium heat, and fill 1/2 way up with boiling water.  Place the pudding on the rack. Steam for 2 1/2 hours.    
Check the pan occasionally and add more water if needed. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center. When firm, place the pudding mold on a rack outside of the water for 10 minutes and unmold.    
Prepare a sauce by blending together the sour cream, cream cheese and confectioners sugar. Spoon dollops over warm pudding and serve.
