Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Sift flour and 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar into a large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in egg yolks with enough water to form a ball. Knead gently on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Roll out to line an 8 inch flan ring, or tart shell. Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until pastry is golden. Allow to cool.    
In a large bowl, combine cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, mangoes and lemon juice. Beat until mixture is fairly smooth, but still has chunks of mangoes. Spread into baked pastry shell and top with blueberries. Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar before serving.
