Grind the chocolate wafers and 3 ounces of chocolate in a food processor; the crumbs should be small.  Mix in 3 tablespoons of sugar.  Melt 7 tablespoons of butter or margarine, and add it to the chocolate crumbs.  Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.    
Melt 12 ounces of chocolate, and cool slightly.  Blend in cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, eggs, 1/2 cup cream, cocoa, vanilla, and peppermint extract.  Pour this in crust.  Bake for one hour at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Cool overnight.    
In a small bowl, mix together the sour cream and 1/4 cup sugar.  Pour on top of cooled cheesecake.  Bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C).  Chill for 6 to 8 hours.    
To decorate the cheesecake make a chocolate icing.  In a small saucepan, simmer 1/2 cup cream and 1 tablespoon butter.  Add to this 6 ounces of chocolate, and stir until melted.  Remove from heat.  Freeze until the mixture is piping consistency (stir occasionally).  Using a pastry bag, pipe a lattice on the top.
