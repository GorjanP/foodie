Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat white sugar, brown sugar, and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat ice cream, egg, and vanilla extract into butter mixture until smooth.    
Whisk flour, malt powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until just combined. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack.
