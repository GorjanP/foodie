Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Melt brown sugar, coconut oil, and agave nectar in a small pot over medium heat; bring to a boil. Remove from heat; add oats and flour. Pour into an 8-inch baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate until solid, at least 20 minutes. Cut into squares; you may need to pick up the whole thing and cut it from the side.
