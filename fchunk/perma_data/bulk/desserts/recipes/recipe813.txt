Roll cookies out approximately 1/4 inch thick and insert cookie sticks at least 1/3 to 1/2 way into cookie.    
Bake cookies at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8-10 minutes.  This dough keeps well in a  covered container in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.    
Decorate as desired.  Display 3-7 cookies in a 6 inch clay pot (depending on size of cookie).  Weigh pot down with dried beans and cut a circle of Styrofoam to fit snugly into top.  Add ribbons and enjoy.
