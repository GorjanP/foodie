Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Stir peaches with lemon juice in a bowl to prevent fruit from browning. Transfer to a cast iron skillet and stir in 1 1/2 cup white sugar, pecans, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Bring to a soft boil, stirring often.    
Whisk self-rising flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Stir melted butter into the mixture (batter should resemble cooked oatmeal). Spoon batter over hot peach filling in the skillet; dot topping with 2 tablespoons of butter pieces and sprinkle with raw sugar.    
Bake cobbler in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
