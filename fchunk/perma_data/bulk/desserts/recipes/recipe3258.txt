Grease a 9x13 inch pan with butter or cooking spray.    
In a large microwave safe bowl, combine butter and marshmallows. Microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth. Remove from the oven and stir in the cereal.    
Press in to the prepared pan with the back of a buttered spoon. Let the treats cool for about 2 hours until set. Cut into squares and serve.
