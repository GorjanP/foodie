In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the corn syrup, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Continue to boil for 5 minutes.    
Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, oats and peanuts. Turn onto a well greased 10x15 inch  jellyroll pan or any cookie sheet with 1 inch sides. When cool enough to touch, grease your hands and pat the mixture down flat in the pan.    
Refrigerate overnight. Let stand for 20 minutes before cutting into squares.
