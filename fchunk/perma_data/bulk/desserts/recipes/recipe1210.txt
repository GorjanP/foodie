Cream together shortening and brown sugar.  Stir in egg and molasses and mix well. Fold in dry ingredients and stir.  Cover and chill until firm (1 - 2 hours).    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Roll dough into small balls (I use a small melon baller to help with this) and roll in white sugar.  Place on lightly greased cookie sheets.    
Bake 9 - 10 minutes.  Leave on cookie sheet one minute until set.
