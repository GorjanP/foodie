Butter a 9x13 inch pan and set aside.    
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Arrange almonds on a cookie sheet and place in oven to toast. Stir frequently. Do not burn. Remove from oven and set aside.    
In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, butter, milk, pumpkin, and spice; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Continue boiling over medium heat until mixture reaches 234 degrees F (118 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes.    
Remove from heat. Stir in butterscotch chips.  When chips are melted,  add marshmallow cream, nuts, and vanilla. Mix until well blended.    
Immediately pour butterscotch mixture into prepared pan. Spread evenly. Cool at room temperture.  Cut into squares, and store in the refrigerator in an air-tight container.
