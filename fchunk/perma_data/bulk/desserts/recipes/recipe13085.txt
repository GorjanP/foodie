Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.    
Combine bananas, cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl. Whisk until well blended, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in peanut butter chips. Divide batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.    
Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Let bread cool in pans for 10 minutes. Remove and finish cooling on a wire rack. Place a second cooling rack on top of a baking sheet.    
Slice loaves in half horizontally and then into 1-inch-thick pieces. Brush 1 side of each slice lightly with honey and place on the prepared cooling rack.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, about 40 minutes. Cool on the rack for at least 10 minutes; the biscotti will become crispier as they cool.
