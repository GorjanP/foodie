Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Line several baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.    
In a separate large bowl, cream brown sugar, butter, and peanut butter together until evenly mixed and smooth.    
Beat in eggs.    
Stir the the flour mixture into the peanut butter mixture to make a smooth dough.    
Place white sugar into a shallow bowl.    
Roll dough into tablespoon-size balls, then roll in the white sugar to coat all sides.    
Place cookies onto the prepared baking sheets at least 1 inch apart.    
Press each cookie down flat with a fork, making a cross-cross pattern.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the bottom, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheets about 5 minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.
