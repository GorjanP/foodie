Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9-inch round cake pans.    
Gently stir strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl; chill.    
Combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl; cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk milk and egg yolks in a bowl, then stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Divide in half and pat into prepared cake pans.    
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large bowl. Continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Spread over dough; sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan to wire rack; cool completely.    
Place one cake layer on a large serving plate; spread with half the whipped cream, spoon half the strawberries over cream. Repeat layers; garnish with mint.
