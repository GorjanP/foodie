Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until the butter is light and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes; beat in sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, at least 5 more minutes.    
Beat in egg yolks one at a time, mixing until each yolk is just combined before adding the next; mix in sour cream  and vanilla and almond extracts.    
Sift flour in a separate bowl with baking powder and salt.    
Stir flour mixture into the liquid ingredients in thirds, alternating with Irish cream liqueur, until the batter is smooth.    
Pour batter into the lined muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cupcakes are golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
