Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Arrange brown sugar, 1 teaspoon per peach, in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top each brown sugar mound with a piece of butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Place a peach half, cut-side down, on top of brown sugar-butter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until peaches are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Plate 2 warm peaches per serving and top with 1 scoop vanilla ice cream.
