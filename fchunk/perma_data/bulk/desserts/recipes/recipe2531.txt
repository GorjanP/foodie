Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar.  Stir in vanilla and eggs.    
In another bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt; add to egg mixture alternately with milk.    
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide strips and, on a well-buttered baking sheet, form into window frames.    
Keeping the colors separate, place candy in plastic bags and crush with a meat mallet.  Place crushed candies inside window frames.    
Bake for six minutes, or until candy is just melted.  Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, until candy is hard.  Carefully lift cookies off baking sheet with spatula.
