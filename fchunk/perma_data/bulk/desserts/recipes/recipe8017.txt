Whisk pudding mix and milk in a bowl for 2 minutes; let stand until thick, about 3 more minutes.    
Layer half the cake cubes into a trifle bowl or glass serving dish. Top cake cubes with half the pudding, half the blueberries, and half the whipped topping. Repeat layers; cover and refrigerate 4 hours before serving.
