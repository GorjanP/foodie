Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Stir matzo cake meal, sugar, potato starch, eggs, chocolate chips, walnuts, and lemon juice together to make a dough.    
Divide the dough into thirds. Shape each piece of dough into a log and place on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes.    
Remove logs from oven and cut into slices.    
Arrange the slices on the baking sheet; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.    
Return to oven and bake until the mandelbread are browned and crisp, about 10 more minutes. Turn the mandelbread after 5 minutes to crisp both sides.
