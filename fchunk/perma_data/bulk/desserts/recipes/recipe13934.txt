Beat cream cheese with an electric hand mixer in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Add sweetened condensed milk and lemonade concentrate; beat until smooth. Stir rum and food coloring into the cream cheese mixture. Fold whipped topping with the cream cheese mixture; pour into pie crust.    
Refrigerate until filling is firm in the center, about 4 hours.
