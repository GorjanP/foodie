Preheat an oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch square baking dish.    
Grind the almonds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and oats in a food processor until they resemble a coarse meal. Stir the ground mixture in a bowl with the cranberries, blueberries, maple syrup, and cinnamon until evenly combined. Moisten your hands with water and press the mixture into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 1 hour until toasted. Cool completely in the baking dish. Cut into 16 bars. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.
