Remove from heat and stir in lemonade concentrate.  Chill in refrigerator until partially set, mixture should be the consistency of unbeaten egg whites, 10 to 20 minutes.    
Pour mixture into large mixing bowl and beat in evaporated milk until light and fluffy, 2 minutes.  Tear angel food cake into bite sized pieces and fold into mixture.  Spoon into a 9x5 inch loaf pan and freeze for 1 hour.  Slice and serve.
