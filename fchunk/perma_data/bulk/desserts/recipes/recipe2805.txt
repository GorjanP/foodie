Beat butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and egg until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Beat in hot water and vanilla.  Gradually beat in flour, baking soda, and salt, until well blended and smooth.  Stir in chocolate chips.    
Drop dough by well-rounded teaspoons onto greased cookie sheets.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 minute, or until golden.  Cool cookie sheet on a wire rack for 1 minutes, then remove cookies to a rack to cool completely.
