In a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisk together all jam ingredients. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 35 to 45 minutes or until a thin jam-like consistency is reached. Jam will thicken further upon cooling. Cool completely, 20 to 25 minutes.    
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll 1 sheet of puff pastry and cut along the lines to make 3 sections. Cut each section in half to form 6 rectangles. Spread cooled jam over each rectangle to about 1/2 inch from the edges. Top with goat cheese. Brush edges lightly with water.    
Cut remaining sheet of puff pastry in the same manner and place one over each filled rectangle. Gently press edges down with the side of a fork, then use the tines to crimp edges. It is okay if a bit of jam seeps out, but try to avoid it if possible. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until pastry reaches a golden brown color and bottoms are no longer doughy. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack to cool completely, about 35 minutes.    
Whisk together all glaze ingredients. Spread a thin layer over each pastry. Top pastries with a couple pinches each of grapefruit zest, thyme, and peppercorns.
