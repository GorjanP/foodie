Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.    
Combine the flour, coconut, pineapple, macadamia nuts, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, rum extract, and vanilla extract. Drop golf ball-sized scoops of the dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until coconut is toasted, 12 to 15 minutes.
