In a bowl, combine gelatin, boiling water, lemon juice and sugar, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  Chill in refrigerator, stirring occasionally, until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon.    
Beat egg whites until stiff.  Beat lemon mixture until frothy.  Fold egg whites into lemon mixture until mixture holds together.  Pour into greased molds and chill until set.
