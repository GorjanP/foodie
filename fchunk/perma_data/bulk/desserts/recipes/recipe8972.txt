Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.    
Whisk together the flour and baking powder in a bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool completely before removing from the pan.
