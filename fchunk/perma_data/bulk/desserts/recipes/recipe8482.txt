Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.    
Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla together in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape sides of bowl with a rubber spatula. Add egg to butter mixture and beat on medium speed until blended. Scrape side of bowl down again.    
Beat flour mixture into butter mixture on low speed until just blended. Scrape bowl and mix a few more seconds.    
Scoop dough into 2 tablespoon-sized balls and arrange on a baking sheet. Cover baking sheet and refrigerate at least 4 hours (overnight is ideal).    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper and arrange cookie balls atop paper.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until partially cooked, 11 minutes.    
Place raspberry jam in a bowl and stir until syrup consistency.    
Press a soda bottle cap into the center of each cookie until edges of cookies bulge and begin to crack, making an indentation. Fill each indentation with about 1 teaspoon jam.    
Bake cookies until edges are lightly browned, 7 minutes longer. Cool cookies completely on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
