Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the mincemeat.    
Drop dough by teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking pans to cool on wire racks.
