Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter or margarine and brown sugar until smooth. Mix in 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, baking powder, egg, and vanilla. Stir in flour by hand using a wooden spoon, as the dough will be stiff.    
Roll out tablespoon sized pieces of dough into 6 inch long ropes. Curl up one end slightly to make the head, then curl the rest of the rope towards the head in a spiral shape to make the snail shell. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Brush cookies with egg white. Mix together the remaining cinnamon and superfine sugar in a small cup. Sprinkle this over the snails. Use chocolate chips to make eyes on the heads.    
Bake cookies for 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are lightly browned. Let cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
