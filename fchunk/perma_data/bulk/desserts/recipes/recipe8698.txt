Lightly grease a small (1-quart) slow cooker.    
Combine brown sugar, baking mix, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger in a food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times to mix. Add butter, evaporated milk, and eggs, and pulse until combined, 5 to 6 pulses. Pour in pumpkin puree, applesauce, and vanilla extract and process until smooth, about 30 seconds.    
Pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared slow cooker. Heat on Low until very thick, about 4 hours.
