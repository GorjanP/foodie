Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Wrap the outside of an 8 inch springform pan with foil.  Generously butter the inside of pan and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs, then shake out excess.    
In a large bowl, Beat cream cheese and sugar on low speed until smooth. Beat in heavy cream, sour cream and half-and-half. Add vanilla and beat in the eggs one at a time. Pour filling into prepared pan. Wrap bottom of the pan on aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in.    
Place cheesecake in a water bath. Bake in the preheated oven for 75 minutes, or until filling is set.
