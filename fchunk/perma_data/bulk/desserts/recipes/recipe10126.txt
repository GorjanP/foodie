Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Combine 1/2 cup sugar with 2 tablespoons flour and mix well. Stir in the molasses, egg, 1 cup water, lemon juice and lemon zest. Mix thoroughly and pour into the unbaked pie shell.    
Cream the butter with the remaining 2/3 cup white sugar until light and fluffy. Add the beaten egg. Sift 1-1/4 cups flour and baking soda together, then add to the creamed mixture alternately with the buttermilk or sour milk (see Cook's Note). Spread over the top of the mixture in the pie shell.    
Bake in preheated oven until filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes.
