Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan.    
Mix together 1/2 cup brown sugar, maple syrup, peach yogurt, banana, 1/4 cup melted butter, egg, and oats in a large bowl until well blended. Allow mixture to rest until the oats have softened, 10 to 20 minutes. Combine all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Stir the flour mixture and peaches into the banana mixture until just combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan.    
Mix the pecans, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, and a pinch of cinnamon in a bowl. Spread pecan mixture over the cake batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
