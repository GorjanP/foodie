Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl until creamy; refrigerate mixture until firm, about 15 minutes. Spread cream cheese mixture onto each sugar cookie. Cover cream cheese layer with strawberries, leaving a small edge of cream cheese to keep strawberry juice contained. Decorate each cookie with blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.    
Warm chocolate shell topping in a microwave-safe bowl, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour chocolate into a plastic freezer bag. Snip one corner off the bag with scissors; pipe chocolate onto cookies. Refrigerate cookies until ready to serve.
