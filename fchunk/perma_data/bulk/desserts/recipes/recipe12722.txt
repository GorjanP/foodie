Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire. Tear off a large sheet of foil or parchment paper, and line the Dutch oven, folding the paper or foil as needed to make it fit (or use a purchased Dutch oven liner).    
In a bowl, lightly toss the bread crumbs, dry milk powder, sugar substitute, pecans, chocolate chips, and salt until thoroughly combined. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with vanilla extract and oil, and whisk in the water. Pour the liquid ingredients into the crumb mixture, and stir to moisten. Pour the pudding mixture into the prepared Dutch oven, and cover the oven.    
Place the oven into the hot coals, and place more glowing coals onto the lid of the oven. Cook covered for 1 hour, and don't peek until the hour is up. Check for firmness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the pudding. If it comes out clean, the pudding is done. If not, recover the oven, and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
