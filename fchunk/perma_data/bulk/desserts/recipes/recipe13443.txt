Combine confectioners' sugar, shortening, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add coconut milk, water, egg replacer, vanilla extract, and almond extract; beat on medium speed until combined.    
Stir flour, cornstarch, and cream of tartar together in a separate bowl. Beat into shortening mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough until firm, at least 3 hours.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Divide dough into small portions. Roll out to 1/4-inch thickness on a generously floured surface. Cut into desired shapes with 2-inch cookie cutters. Place cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 10 to 12 minutes.
