Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie pan; prick with a fork in 1-inch intervals.    
Bake pie crust in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely on a rack.    
Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl until smooth; spread evenly over cooled bottom of pie crust.    
Blend 1 cup strawberries, 3/4 cup sugar, strawberry juice, and cornstarch in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a 3-quart pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until mixture boils and thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.    
Stir remaining 5 cups strawberries into the hot strawberry glaze; mix to coat. Let cool until tepid, about 25 minutes. Pour onto cream cheese layer in pie crust. Chill until set and firm enough to slice, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.
