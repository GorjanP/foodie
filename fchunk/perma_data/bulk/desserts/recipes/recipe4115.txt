Butter an 8x8 inch square dish.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, white sugar, cream, corn syrup and salt.  Stir until sugar is dissolved.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and let cool without stirring until bottom of pan is lukewarm.  Pour in vanilla and beat until creamy.  Stir in nuts.  Pour into prepared pan.    
Let cool completely before cutting into squares.
