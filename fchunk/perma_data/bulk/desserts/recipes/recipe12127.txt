Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Mix cake mix, coconut milk, eggs, oil, and water together in a bowl using an electric mixer for 2 minutes; pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
