Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.    
Mix cake flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, allspice, mace, and salt together in a large bowl.    
Combine sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat well. Beat in pineapple and carrots. Mix in flour mixture until well blended. Fold pecans and golden raisins into the batter.    
Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a large plate. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
