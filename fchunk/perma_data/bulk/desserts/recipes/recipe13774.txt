Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Stir dry milk, honey, and vanilla together in a bowl; beat in eggs. Whisk milk into egg mixture until custard batter is well-blended. Divide custard batter between 4 custard cups and sprinkle each with nutmeg. Place custard cups in a shallow pan filled with hot water.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 40 minutes. Chill completely before serving.
