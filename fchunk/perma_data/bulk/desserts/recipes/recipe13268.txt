Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Mix cinnamon cake mix, flavoring packet, dates, walnuts, egg white substitute, and olive oil together in a large bowl.    
Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of cake mixture onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms start to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet, about 10 minutes.
