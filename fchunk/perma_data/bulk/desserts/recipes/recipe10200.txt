Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.    
In a small bowl, mix together the milk and the lemon juice or vinegar.  Set aside.    
Cream together the butter or margarine and the sugar.  Separate the eggs,  keeping two of the whites and all of the yolks.  Beat the egg yolks.    
Dissolve the cocoa in the hot water.    
Add the soured milk mixture, the yolks, the cocoa, and the vanilla to the creamed mixture. Add the flour and soda. Beat at a low speed for 2 to 3 minutes.    
Beat 2 of the egg whites to stiff peaks.  Fold the beaten egg whites into the batter and pour into a greased loaf pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 60 minutes.
