Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.    
Place sugar, butter, eggs, and peppermint extract in a bowl. Stir until well combined.    
Combine rice flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually pour into the butter mixture; mix to fully combine. Fold chocolate chips into the dough.    
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and edges start to darken, 8 to 10 minutes.
