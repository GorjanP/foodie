Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Cream together  butter or margarine, white sugar, and brown sugar.  Add  eggs and  vanilla.    
Mix together in a separate bowl: salt, baking powder, baking soda, flour and  oatmeal (put small amounts of oatmeal in blender until it turns to powder. Measure out 5 cups of oatmeal and only "powderize" that, NOT 5 cups "powderized" oatmeal).    
Mix all of the above.    
Add: chocolate chips,  grated chocolate bar, and chopped nuts (any kind).    
Bake on greased cookie sheet (make golf ball sized balls) and bake about two inches apart. Bake  for 8 -10 minutes. Do not overbake.
