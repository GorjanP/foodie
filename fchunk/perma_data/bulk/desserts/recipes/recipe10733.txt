Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix 2 cups and 2 tablespoons flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.    
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy; add egg, egg yolk, peanut butter, and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Slowly pour flour mixture into sugar mixture and stir just until dough is combined; fold in pretzels and chocolate-hazelnut spread.    
Drop dough onto a baking sheet using 2 spoons.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes; rotate baking sheet and continue baking until cookies are fully cooked and still soft in the middle, about 7 minutes more. Cool cookies on baking sheet for about 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
