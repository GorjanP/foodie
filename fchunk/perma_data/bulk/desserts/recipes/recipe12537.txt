Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Mix flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in butter until evenly incorporated. Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish to form crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is firm and lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle toffee pieces on top; spread evenly with a spatula as they melt over the hot crust.    
Melt caramels in a saucepan over medium-low heat, about 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream until smooth.    
Pour melted caramel sauce over toffee layer. Sprinkle pecans on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 minutes. Cool until set, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut into bars.
