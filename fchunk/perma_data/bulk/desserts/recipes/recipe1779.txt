Mix sugar, flour, and cinnamon in large bowl. Add fruit. Add lemon juice, and stir well.    
Pour into a 9 inch unbaked pie shell. Dot with the butter or margarine. Cover with top crust and flute edges. Cut small slits in the top.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour. I put a baking sheet under mine to catch any liquid that might bubble over.
