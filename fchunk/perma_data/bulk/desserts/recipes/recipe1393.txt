Core the apples, leaving the bottom intact.    
In a bowl, mix the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon the sugar mixture into the apples and  set a teaspoon (or more to your taste) of butter on top of each apple. Place the apples in a deep casserole dish and cover.    
Microwave for 3  1/2 to 4 minutes or until tender. Let the apples sit for a couple minutes before serving.
