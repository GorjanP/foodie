Melt butter or margarine in 9 x 13 inch pan.    
Mix together the flour, sugar, and milk.  Pour mixture into the pan.  Spread peaches, including syrup,  evenly around the pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until the crust turns golden brown.  Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
