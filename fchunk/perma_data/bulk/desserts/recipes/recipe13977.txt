Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Beat butter and sugar together using an electric mixer until fluffy. Blend in vanilla extract and salt. Mix in flour and ground pecans. Shape about 1 tablespoon of dough into a finger, about 3 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Repeat with remaining dough to form about 50 fingers total.    
Place fingers 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet; they will expand a little while baking. Stick an almond 'nail' onto the end of each finger. Lightly score some 'knuckles' into the centers using a knife.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and very lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Let cool.
