Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease one 9 x 13 inch pan.    
Dissolve soda in boiling water. Set aside.    
Mix together flour, brown sugar, salt, and vegetable oil to form a crumb-like mixture.  Reserve 1 cup of the crumbs.  Mix the remaining crumbs with the water and soda mixture.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.  Sprinkle the reserved crumbs on top.    
Bake for 45 minutes, or until done.
