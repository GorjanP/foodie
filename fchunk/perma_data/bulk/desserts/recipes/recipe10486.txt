Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine peanut butter, sweetener, egg, and vanilla extract in a bowl; mix well until a dough is formed.    
Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Place on the prepared baking sheet and press down twice with a fork in a criss-cross pattern.    
Bake in the the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
