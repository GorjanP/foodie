Line a 4 quart round mixing bowl with parchment paper.    
Break cake up into small bite-sized pieces.    
Drain the crushed pineapple, reserve the syrup. You should have 1 cup of syrup if not add enough water to make 1 cup.    
Dissolve the gelatin in the 4 tablespoons of cold water. Add the boiling water, pineapple syrup, sugar and lemon juice. Mix well and place in the refrigerator until mixture just starts to thicken.    
Add the crushed pineapple to the gelatin mix and then fold in 4 cups of the whipped topping.    
Place a layer of cake pieces, then a layer of the pineapple mixture in the prepared bowl. Continue until all the cake and pineapple mixture is used up. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours or overnight.    
Turn the chilled cake out onto a serving platter and frost it with the remaining whipped topping and sprinkle with the coconut.
