Grease a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon butter.    
Combine cashews, sugar, and corn syrup in a large microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Microwave on high until sugar melts and mixture is hot, about 6 1/2 minutes.    
Stir 1 tablespoon butter and vanilla extract into cashew mixture. Microwave until hot, about 2 1/2 minutes more. Stir baking soda into cashew mixture until light and foamy. Spread mixture on prepared baking sheet. Cool completely and break into pieces.
