Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.    
Beat butter, sugars and vanilla in a huge bowl.  Beat eggs WELL and add to flour mixture.  Mix flour mixture into butter mixture and stir well.    
Add the semi-sweet chocolate pieces and walnuts.  Mix well.    
Drop by rounded tablespoons on ungreased baking sheets.  (I lightly push about  4-6 plain  M and M's on top of each cookie for flavor and color.)    
Bake for 11 minutes.  Don't overbake or they get hard.  Let cool on wire racks.  Enjoy!
