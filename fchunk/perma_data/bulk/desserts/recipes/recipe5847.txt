Beat the mascarpone cheese, confectioners sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.  Fold in the whipped cream.  Spoon cheese mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tip.    
Leaving the stem end in tact, cut off the tip of each strawberry, and carefully remove the core using a small, thin knife.  Stand strawberries upright (stem end down), and slice through the tip toward the stem.  Do not cut completely through.  Repeat, slicing a total of 4 times.  Each strawberry will have 8 sections.  Roll the strawberries in the sugar.    
Gently open each strawberry and fill each with the cheese mixture, using a circular motion.  Arrange strawberry roses on a platter, and sprinkle with lemon zest.
