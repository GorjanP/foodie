Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (or to 300 degrees F if using dark nonstick pan). Place paper liners in 24 miniature muffin cups.    
Crust: Place walnuts and 4 teaspoons sugar in food processor; pulse until finely ground. Add melted butter and pulse until combined. Press 1 teaspoon walnut mixture firmly into bottom of each prepared muffin cup. Bake 5 minutes. Cool.    
Filling: Place cream cheese and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl. Beat with electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Add pumpkin, sour cream, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg; beat until well blended. Add egg, beating on low speed just until blended. Spoon evenly over crusts.    
Bake 20 minutes or until centers are almost set. Cool completely in pan, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or until chilled. Top with the Reddi-wip just before serving. Sprinkle with additional cinnamon, if desired.
