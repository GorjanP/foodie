Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a couple of cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and lard. Gradually mix in the egg, and  molasses. Sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, dry mustard, instant coffee, and cloves; stir this into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.    
Drop cookie dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Press a raisin or maraschino cherry into the center of each one.  Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
