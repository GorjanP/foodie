Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine graham cracker crumbs, softened butter or margarine, and 2 tablespoons sugar.  Press mixture onto bottom of a greased  9 x 13 inch baking pan.  Bake for 20 minutes.    
Beat  eggs, sugar, flour, and lemon juice.  (If mixture is too thick, water may be added to thin it.)  Pour the mixture over the hot graham cracker crust.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.    
Dust the top with confectioners' sugar.  After cooling, cut into squares.
