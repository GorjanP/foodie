Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Place pears in a small ovenproof pan. Mix orange juice with 1/4 cup sugar and pour over pears.    
Cook in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes; occasionally turn and sprinkle remaining sugar over pears. Remove pears from oven when soft and let cool.    
Pour orange juice mixture into a medium saucepan and simmer over medium heat until mixture thickens to the consistency of cream; remove from heat.    
In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt chocolate.  Add a few tablespoons of hot milk if the chocolate becomes too thick to stir.    
Put each pear in a small bowl. Pour the creamy orange sauce over each pear, then drizzle chocolate on top; serve warm.
