Heat 3/4 cup milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until simmering, stirring constantly.    
Remove saucepan from heat and stir in 1/4 cup margarine. Allow mixture to cool until lukewarm.    
Using the bread hook with an electric mixer, mix together the self-rising flour, yeast, and sugar and sucralose blend in a large mixing bowl.    
Stir the water, egg, and warm milk into the yeast mixture using the electric mixer; stir well to combine.    
Gradually stir in half of the whole wheat flour until no dry spots remain.    
Stir in the remaining flour, a 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.    
When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.    
Cover dough with a damp cloth and allow to rest for 10 minutes.    
Mix the cream cheese, bananas, and pineapple together in a bowl.    
Stir in the pineapple extract and 3 packets of sweetener; mixture will be lumpy.    
Roll the dough out to about 9x12-inches.    
Spread the banana filling about 2-inches away from one of the longer edges.    
Roll the dough into a cylinder shape, beginning with the edge without filling.    
Pinch the seam to seal.    
Shape the dough into a ring by bringing the two open edges together; pinch to seal.    
Wipe any filling from the outside of the ring.    
Cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise for 30 minutes more.    
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Transfer the dough ring to a greased and floured baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes.    
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.    
Mix 1 tablespoon margarine with confectioners' sugar in a small bowl.    
Stir in the remaining milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the mixture is easily drizzled.    
Drizzle about 1/4 of the icing over the cooled cake.    
Divide the remaining icing into 3 small bowls.    
Stir in the green food coloring into one bowl; stir the yellow food coloring into the next bowl; and stir the purple food coloring into the last bowl.    
Drizzle each of the colored icings over the cake.
