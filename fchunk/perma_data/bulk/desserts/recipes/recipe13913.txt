Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar and honey. Bring to a boil; let cool, about 10 minutes.    
Whisk flour, cinnamon, and cloves together in a bowl.    
Mix baking soda and water together in a bowl; stir into butter mixture. Mix in eggs. Add flour-spice mixture; stir until dough is combined. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.    
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Roll dough out; cut into cookies and place on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
