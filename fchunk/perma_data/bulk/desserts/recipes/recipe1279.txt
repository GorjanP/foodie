Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Combine brownie mix, oil, egg and water in a large bowl.   Stir 50 strokes with a spoon.    
Place batter in a cupcake pan (cupcake wrappers recommended).  Once cups are 3/4 of the way full, place an unwrapped miniature peanut butter cup in the middle, then bake for 30-35 minutes keeping an eye on them while they're baking.   Let them cool and then they're ready to eat!!
