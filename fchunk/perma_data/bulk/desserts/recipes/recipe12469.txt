Preheat the grill to medium heat.    
Fold the Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil in half, making a rectangle, and place it onto the grill in the center.    
Place the graham crackers onto the foil and place the chocolate squares on top.    
Close the grill and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes until the chocolate has melted. Using a spatula, transfer the crackers to a plate.    
Scoop some ice cream over top of one of the crackers with chocolate, and then top with the other cracker and chocolate. Serve immediately.
