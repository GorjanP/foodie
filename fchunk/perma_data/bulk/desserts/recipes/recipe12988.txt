Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in brown sugar and 1 dash of cinnamon. Mix well until bubbles start to appear. Add banana; cook, stirring gently, until it starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer banana to a bowl; roughly slice into 1/4-inch chunks using a spoon. Let filling cool briefly.    
Whisk water and flour together in a small bowl to make the paste. Mix white sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in another small bowl.    
Lay 1 lumpia strip on a flat work surface. Place 3/4- to 1 teaspoon of filling in the lower corner of the wrapper; fold 1 corner over the filling and enclose, forming a triangle. Fold over the other edges to finish the triangle, smearing the last fold with the paste to seal. Place triangle on a plate, seam-side down. Repeat with remaining wrappers, filling, and paste.    
Heat 2 inches of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the triangles in batches until golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper towel and sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the warm triangles.
