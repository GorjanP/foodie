Mix sugar, shortening, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well combined.    
Stir flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; mix into sugar-shortening mixture until a dough forms.    
Form dough into a roll 2 inches in diameter; wrap in waxed paper and twist the ends to seal. Chill dough until firm, about 15 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Unwrap dough; use a thin, sharp knife to make 1/8-inch slices. Place cookies on an ungreased baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
