Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
In a 1 quart baking dish combine rice, salt and sugar.  Stir in scalded milk and dot with butter.    
Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until rice is very tender and milk is thick and creamy.  Stir gently with a fork every 15 minutes during the first hour.
