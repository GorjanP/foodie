Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter muffin tins and set aside.    
Beat together the cream cheese, egg, sugar and salt. Stir in chocolate chips and set aside.    
In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add the water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla.  Beat until well combined.  Batter will be thin.    
Fill muffin cups 1/3 full with the chocolate batter.  Top each one with a spoonful of cream cheese mixture.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes.
