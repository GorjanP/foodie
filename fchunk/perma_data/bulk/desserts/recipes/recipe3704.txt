Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 24 mini muffin cups.    
In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups coconut, sugar, flour, vanilla and egg whites; stir well. Divide mixture evenly among the prepared mini muffin cups, pressing mixture into bottom and up sides of muffin cups (use cooking spray on hands to prevent the mixture from sticking to your hands).    
Bake in the preheated 400 degree F (200 degrees C) oven until the edges are browned.  Cool 2 minutes in the muffin tins on a wire rack.  Remove from tins and cool completely on a wire rack.    
Prepare lemon pudding mix according to package instructions. Spoon lemon mixture into each macaroon tartlet shell. Top with 2 teaspoons of whipped topping sprinkled with 1/2 teaspoon coconut.
