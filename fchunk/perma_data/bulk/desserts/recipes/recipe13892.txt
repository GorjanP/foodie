Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with 1/4 cup butter and dust with bread crumbs.    
Mix 3/4 cup butter, flour, sugar, milk, cardamom, and baking powder together lightly in a bowl to form a moderately stiff and lumpy dough; transfer dough to the prepared tube pan. Sprinkle cinnamon and pearl sugar over the top of the dough, respectively.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
