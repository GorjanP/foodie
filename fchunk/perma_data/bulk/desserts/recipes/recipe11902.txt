Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with foil baking cups.    
Combine chocolate wafer crumbs and butter in a medium bowl; divide mixture evenly among the prepared muffin cups, pressing firmly to form crusts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 6 minutes. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Keep oven on.    
Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Beat in sweetened condensed milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract into a smooth filling. Divide filling evenly over the cooled crusts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Remove foil baking cups gently.    
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over cheesecake bites and sprinkle with peppermint candies. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
