Place pears in a saucepan. Add sugar, orange, and cinnamon stick. Pour in red wine to cover pears completely. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer gently until pears are soft and deep red in color, about 2 1/2 hours.    
Transfer pears to a serving plate using a slotted spoon. Serve the pears warm or cold.
