Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mix flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.    
Whisk maple syrup, applesauce, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Add to the flour mixture; stir until dough is well combined. Fold in chocolate chips, oats, and nuts; mix to incorporate.    
Scoop a scant 1/4 cup of dough for each cookie; shape into a ball and place on baking sheet. Gently press to flatten.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly browned, about 12 minutes.
