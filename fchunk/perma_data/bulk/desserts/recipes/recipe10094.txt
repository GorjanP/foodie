Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mash beans, molasses, and oil together in a bowl using a potato masher or fork. Stir rice flour, amaranth, cinnamon, and ginger into bean mixture until dough is well combined; fold in raisins. Form dough into 24 small balls and arrange on prepared baking sheet. Slightly flatten balls onto baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are slightly hardened, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
