Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate.    
Fill pie plate with apples, creating a slight mound.    
Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or knife and fork until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle over apples.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and bubbling and top is lightly golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool before slicing, about 15 minutes.
