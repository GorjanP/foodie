Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla extract; gradually add cake mix. Stir semisweet chocolate chips and miniature marshmallows into the dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap.    
Refrigerate dough until firm, about 2 hours.    
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are slightly brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
