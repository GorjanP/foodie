Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease mini-muffin tins.

Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes, until set.    
While cups are baking, combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup evaporated milk in microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave on high 2 minutes, until mixture comes to a boil.  Stir in marshmallows until melted.  Stir in coconut until well combined.  Spoon into baked shells while mixture is still warm.    
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine 1/4 cup evaporated milk, chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons margarine.  Microwave on high 1 minute, remove from oven and stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.  Stir in almonds until well coated.  Spoon over coconut mixture and spread to cover.  Cool completely before removing from pans.  Store in refrigerator or freezer.
