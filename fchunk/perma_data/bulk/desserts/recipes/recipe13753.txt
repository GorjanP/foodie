Combine blueberries and honey in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla extract, lavender, and salt and mix well. Reduce heat to low and continue to simmer until the berries have completely broken down and resemble a chunky jam, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Chill in the refrigerator.    
Whisk coconut milk, honey and nutmeg together in a bowl. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions until mixture has thickened, 10 to 20 minutes. Add chilled blueberry jam and churn until jam is well mixed into the ice cream, about 2 minutes more.    
Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
