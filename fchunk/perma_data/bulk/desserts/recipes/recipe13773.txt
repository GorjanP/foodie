Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Roll prepared pie crust pastry out on a lightly floured surface; cut into circles using a biscuit cutter. Press pastry circles into 12 individual size tart tins.    
Beat corn syrup, brown sugar, eggs, melted butter, and salt together in a mixing bowl until frothy, about 2 minutes.    
Sprinkle about 2 teaspoons pecans into bottom of each tart shell; pour in egg mixture to fill shells 3/4 full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and pastry is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Allow tarts to cool for 10 minutes; remove from tart tins.
