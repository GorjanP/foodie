In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine corn syrup and white sugar. Bring to a boil, boil for one minute, and remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter until well blended. Mix in cereal until evenly coated. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper.    
In a glass bowl in the microwave, or using a double boiler, melt chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, stirring frequently until smooth. Drizzle on the top of the cookies.
