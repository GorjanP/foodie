Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Spread mealworms on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until mealworms are dry, brittle, and easily crushed, about 2 hours.    
Transfer mealworms to a blender; grind until they are the consistency of wheat germ. Increase oven heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease another baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Cream butter in a bowl using an electric mixer; mix in the ground mealworms, flour, brown sugar, white sugar, chocolate chips, oats, egg, vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda. Drop cookie batter by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
