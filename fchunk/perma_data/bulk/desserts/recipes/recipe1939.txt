Blend together the peanut butter, sugar and  melted butter. Allow to chill in refrigerator.    
Roll into 1 inch round balls and return to refrigerator.    
In a double boiler over medium heat, melt the chocolate and shortening. Whisk together until smooth.    
With a toothpick inserted in the balls, dip them into the chocolate so they look like buckeyes. Place on waxed paper and allow to set in refrigerator.
