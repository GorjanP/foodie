Dissolve orange gelatin mix in boiling water in a bowl. Stir juice from mandarin oranges, orange juice, and sugar-free orange drink into gelatin mixture. Melt enough ice cubes into the gelatin mixture so you have 1 1/2 cups total; refrigerate until thick and softly set, 6 to 8 hours.    
Stir mandarin oranges into gelatin and gently fold whipped topping into the dessert; refrigerate until fully set, about 2 more hours.
