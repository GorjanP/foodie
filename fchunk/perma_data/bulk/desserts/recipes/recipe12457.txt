Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour melted butter into an 8-inch square baking dish.    
Mix mangoes, 1/2 cup sugar, and peach schnapps together in a bowl. Layer mango slices over the butter in the baking dish and pour remaining juice over all.    
Mix flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Add milk and stir batter to combine.    
Pour or drop batter evenly over the mango in the baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top layer is browned nicely, 45 to 50 minutes. Let rest about 5 minutes before serving.
