Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners.    
Spread a heaping teaspoon of crushed cookies over the bottom of each muffin cup.    
Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl using a electric mixer until smooth. Blend in milk. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract; mix until smooth. Fill each muffin cup half-full with batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the center of a cupcake no longer jiggles when pressed, 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool, 1 to 2 hours.
