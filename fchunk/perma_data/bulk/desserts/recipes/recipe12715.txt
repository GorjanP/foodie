Line a 9-inch square pan with a piece of aluminum foil long enough to extend over the sides of the pan by several inches and generously grease the foil with butter.    
Mix confectioners' sugar with milk and 1/4 cup butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until combined; bring to a full rolling boil. Boil fudge for 5 minutes without stirring. Reduce heat to low and stir in white chocolate until melted and combined.    
Remove from heat and stir in almond extract, sliced almonds, dried apricots, dried cherries, and dried cranberries. Spread fudge into the prepared pan and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Lift the fudge out of the pan using the foil and peel foil from fudge. Discard foil; cut fudge into 1-inch pieces. Store in refrigerator.
