Combine flour, coconut oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; mix until mixture forms large crumbles. Pour in ice water in a steady stream and continue to mix until dough comes together, about 30 seconds.    
Transfer dough to a large sheet of plastic wrap. Form into a disc and wrap tightly. Chill for 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Press 3/4 of the dough into the bottom of a broiler-safe pie plate.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let crust cool completely.    
Combine 2 cups sugar, coconut cream, eggs, egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate until set, 20 to 30 minutes.    
Beat egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff, glossy peaks form, 6 to 7 minutes.    
Pour chilled curd into the cooled crust. Dollop big spoonfuls of meringue all over the curd.    
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Broil in the preheated oven until meringue is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Chill pie until set, 3 to 24 hours.
