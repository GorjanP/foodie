Line a jelly roll pan with waxed paper and spray with cooking spray.    
In a small, heavy saucepan over low heat, combine crushed candies and corn syrup; stir constantly.    
Spoon melted candy into the well of each plastic spoon.  Place spoons on prepared pan with their handles on the edge of the pan to keep the spoons level.  Cool at room temperature until candy hardens.  Store in airtight containers.
