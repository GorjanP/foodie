Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; mash butter into the flour mixture until crumbly. Stir boiling water into the flour mixture to form a dough.    
Dissolve cornstarch in cold water in a separate large bowl. Stir blueberries, raspberries,  3/4 cup sugar, and lemon juice into the cornstarch mixture; transfer to a cast-iron skillet and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Drop dough into the skillet by the spoonful. Put skillet onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until the topping is golden brown, about 25 minutes.
