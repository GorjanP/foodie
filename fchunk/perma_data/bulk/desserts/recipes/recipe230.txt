In small bowl blend flour, cocoa and baking soda.  Mix until well blended.    
In large bowl beat white and brown sugars, butter or margarine and 1/4 cup peanut butter, until light and fluffy.  Add vanilla and egg, beat. Stir in flour mixture until blended.  Set aside.    
To make Filling:  Combine confectioner's sugar and 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Blend well.    
Roll filling into 30 1-inch balls.  For each cookie, with floured hands, shape about 1 tablespoon of dough around 1 peanut butter ball, covering completely.  Place 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten with glass dipped in white sugar.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 7-9 minutes. When cookies are done, they should be set and slightly cracked.
