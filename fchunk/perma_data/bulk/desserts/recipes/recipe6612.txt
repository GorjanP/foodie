In a medium bowl, mix together 1 1/3 cups shredded coconut, sugar, and ricotta cheese to form a dough-like texture. Divide into 16 portions. Roll each portion into a ball, pressing one almond each into the center of each; cool in freezer for 20 minutes.    
Place the white chocolate in a large stainless steel bowl and set over a saucepan of barely simmering water to melt. While the chocolate is melting, stir in the heavy cream. Use a toothpick or fork to dip the truffles in the chocolate mixture. Arrange coated truffles on a platter. Sprinkle 1/4 cup coconut over the truffles while the chocolate is still melted. Cool in refrigerator until the chocolate coating solidifies.
