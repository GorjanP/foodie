Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch fluted tube pan, such as a Bundt(R), with cooking spray.    
Mix the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil, lemon pudding mix, lemon extract, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth, and stir in candied cherries, pineapple, pecans, and dried cranberries. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 20 minutes before turning it out onto a cake plate to finish cooling. Store in a covered container to help retain moisture.
