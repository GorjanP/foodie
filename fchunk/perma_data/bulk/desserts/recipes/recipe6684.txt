Drain pineapple, reserving syrup. Add enough water to the juice to  make 2 cups liquid. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the  liquid with the gelatin; stir until dissolved.  Remove from heat, and chill until partially set.    
Beat together the cream cheese and salad dressing; add to gelatin mixture and mix. Fold in whipped topping and mix well. Take out 1 1/2 cups of mixture, and reserve.  To the remaining mixture add the pineapple, cranberries, nuts, and apples.    
Pour gelatin and fruit mixture into a large dish or bowl, and top with reserved mixture. Refrigerate until chilled.
