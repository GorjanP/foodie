Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
In a medium mixing bowl whisk together eggs and sugar. Pour milk into a small saucepan and place over low heat until warm. Pour milk over egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly. Stir in nutmeg, if desired, then pour into pie shell.    
Bake for 10 minutes at  425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook 20 minutes longer, or until custard is just set. Chill before serving.
