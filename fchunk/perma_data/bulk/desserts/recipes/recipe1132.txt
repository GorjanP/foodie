In a microwave-safe bowl, or in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, cook chocolate until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.  Holding berries by the stem, dip each one in molten chocolate, about three-quarters of the way to the stem.  Place, stem side down, on wire rack and chill in refrigerator until hardened.
