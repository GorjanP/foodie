Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Beat brown sugar, white sugar, butter, and coconut oil together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until just combined.    
Combine all-purpose flour, almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk to mix evenly. Pour into the butter mixture; stir until well combined. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes.
