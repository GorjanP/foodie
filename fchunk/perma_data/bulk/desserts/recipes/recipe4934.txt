Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Beat together the chocolate cake mix, 1 cup milk, eggs, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moist. Beat for 2 more minutes on medium speed.    
Fill each muffin cup about 2/3 full of batter.    
Sprinkle the cupcakes with cinnamon sugar.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.    
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.    
Cream together 1/2 cup butter and shortening in a bowl until smooth.    
Stir in sea salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, cocoa powder, and 3 cups confectioners' sugar.    
Stir in milk.    
Mix in 2 more cups confectioners' sugar or as needed until desired consistency is achieved.    
Spread the frosting on the cooled cupcakes.
