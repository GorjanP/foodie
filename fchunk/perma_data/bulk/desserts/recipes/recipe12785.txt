Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.    
Combine cooked rice, cashew milk, coconut milk, coconut flakes, maple syrup, chia seeds, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a bowl; mix well. Cover and refrigerate until firm, 8 hours to overnight.
