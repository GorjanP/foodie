Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix almond flour, milk powder, and melted butter together in an 8x8-inch baking dish. Press mixture into the bottom of the pan to form a crust.    
Sprinkle coconut and chocolate chips over the crust in the baking dish; pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over the top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and coconut is lightly toasted, about 30 minutes.
