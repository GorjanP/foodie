Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.    
Whisk brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, oats, and cinnamon together in a bowl; gradually stir in oil until mixture is crumbly. Press half the crumb mixture into the prepared pan; set remaining crumbs aside for topping.    
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 10 minutes. Remove crust from oven and cool slightly, leaving oven on.    
Place serviceberries and water in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes; stir in lemon juice. Whisk white sugar and 2 tablespoons flour together in a small bowl; stir sugar mixture into berries and cook until the mixture begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes; pour berry filling over crumb crust.    
Sprinkle cream cheese pieces evenly over berry filling. Spread remaining crumb mixture over cream cheese layer and press gently with a potato masher.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crumb topping is golden and filling is bubbly, about 40 minutes.
