Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix apples and cranberries in an 8-inch square baking dish. Mix oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; stir in applesauce and soy milk until clumps form. Spoon oat mixture over apple mixture, pressing down slightly.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes.
