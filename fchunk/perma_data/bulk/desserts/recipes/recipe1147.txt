Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix crushed pretzels, margarine and sugar.    
Press crushed pretzel mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven 8 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.    
Blend together the cream cheese and sugar. Fold in whipped topping and spread evenly over cooled pretzel mixture.    
In a medium bowl, dissolve the strawberry flavored gelatin in boiling water. Mix in strawberries and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.    
Pour gelatin mixture over cream cheese mixture and refrigerate until set, about 4 hours.
