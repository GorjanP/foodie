Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat butter, sugar, and vanilla seeds in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla and lemon extracts.    
Combine flour, coconut, pudding mix, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to the creamed mixture in batches, stirring until combined. Drop cookie dough onto baking sheets using a teaspoon or cookie scoop.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly golden, 10 to 11 minutes. Leave on the baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes before removing to a rack to cool completely.
