Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.    
Melt chocolate chips and coconut oil in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.    
Blend chickpeas, eggs, sugar, baking powder, and vanilla extract together in a blender or food processor until smooth. Add chocolate mixture and blend until smooth. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
