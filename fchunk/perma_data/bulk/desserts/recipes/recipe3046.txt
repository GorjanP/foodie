Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.    
Mix flour, sugar, butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl using a pastry blender or fork until crumbly; reserve 3/4 cup flour mixture to use as topping.    
Sprinkle a light layer of flour mix into the prepared baking dish; top with a layer of apples. Continue alternating layers of flour mixture with apples and ending with apples. Sprinkle top apple layer with the reserved 3/4 cup flour mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and topping is lightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow cobbler to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
