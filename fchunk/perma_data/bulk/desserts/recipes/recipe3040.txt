Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.    
Stir together the cake flour, baking powder, salt, and super fine sugar.    
Separate the eggs save the egg yolks for another use. In a glass or copper bowl beat the egg whites until foamy.    
Mix 1 1/2 cups of the heavy cream with the vanilla. Stir into the flour mixture then fold in the egg whites. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C ) for 30 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans for ten minutes then invert onto a wire rack to continue cooling. Once cakes are completely cool frost with fresh whipped cream and serve with fresh strawberries.    
To Make Frosting: Beat on low speed until stiff 1 1/2 cups heavy cream (make sure it's very cold).  Beat in the confectioners' sugar and 2 1/2  teaspoons brandy.  Use immediately to frost cake.
