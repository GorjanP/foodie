Cream shortening.  Add remaining 1-1/4 cups sugar gradually, and cream together until light and fluffy.  Add flour alternately with milk, a small amount at a time; beat after each addition until smooth.  Stir in vanilla.  Add meringue, and beat thoroughly into batter.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pan or pans.
