Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and honey. Stir in the egg and peanut butter. Combine the flour and baking powder, mix into the peanut butter mixture. Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls.  Place 3 inches apart on cookie sheets. Dip a fork into flour and press deeply across top of each cookie in a criss cross pattern.    
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned.  Cool on wire racks.  Store in tightly covered container.
