Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheet.    
Cream butter, sugar and pre-melted chocolate. Stir in eggs and vanilla; beat until smooth. Sprinkle baking soda over mixture. Slowly blend in the flour. Fold in the white chocolate, semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips.    
Drop the dough by tablespoons onto a lightly greased cookie sheet (or parchment paper) about 1 inch apart.    
Bake 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to overbake! Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for about 10 minutes, then place them on a wire rack to finish cooling.
