Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In large bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in cream cheese, egg, and vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; mix into creamed mixture to form a soft dough. Fold in the melted chocolate until the dough is just marbled. Do not over mix. Drop dough by heaping teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart.    
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are light golden brown. Cool completely before storing.
