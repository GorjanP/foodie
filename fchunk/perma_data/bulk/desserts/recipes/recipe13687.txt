Cut the round watermelon slice into 8 wedges, keeping them together for a nice presentation, and place on a serving dish.    
Spoon yogurt evenly over watermelon, stopping before the rind. Drizzle with honey. Sprinkle blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, pistachios, and shredded coconut evenly over the yogurt. Serve immediately.
