Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at time. Next, stir in the vanilla and buttermilk alternately with the sifted ingredients. Cover dough and chill overnight.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease cookie sheets.    
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart. Combine the cinnamon and sugar, sprinkle some of the mixture onto each cookie.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
