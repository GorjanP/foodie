Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.    
Place graham crackers side-by-side to cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over graham crackers.    
Heat butter, brown sugar, and vanilla in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted and mixture starts to bubble. Pour mixture over chocolate chips and crackers. Sprinkle miniature marshmallows over the top.    
Place baking pan under the broiler until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from broiler, cool completely, and cut into squares.
