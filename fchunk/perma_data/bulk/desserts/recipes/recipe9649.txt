Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.   Grease cookie sheets.         
In a large mixing bowl, beat together all ingredients.         
Drop by teaspoon on cookie sheets and flatten slightly with a fork.           
Bake for 10 minutes or until brown at the edges.  Be careful to not overbake.  Cool and store in an airtight container.
