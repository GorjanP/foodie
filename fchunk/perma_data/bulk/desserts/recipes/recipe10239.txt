Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; remove from heat. Add rice cereal, brown sugar, coconut, and pecans; stir well. Pat half the cereal mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Cut slices of ice cream and spread on top of cereal mixture; layer the remaining cereal mixture on top of ice cream layer.    
Place in freezer until set, at least 1 hour. Cut into squares when ready to serve.
