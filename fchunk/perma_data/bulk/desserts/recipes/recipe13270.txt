Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.    
Mix red velvet cake mix, butter, 1 egg, and 1 egg yolk together in a large bowl. Press evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.    
Whisk cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Beat in 1 egg until smooth. Beat in 1 egg yolk.    
Spread cream cheese mixture over the red velvet layer in the pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pan, about 30 minutes. Cut into bars.
