Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Prepare cake mix according to package directions for a 10-inch tube pan. Stir in the cinnamon and vanilla extract, then fold in the chopped apples.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool.
