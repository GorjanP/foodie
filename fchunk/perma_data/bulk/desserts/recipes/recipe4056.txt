Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In medium skillet, over medium heat, heat butter until lightly browned.  Be careful not to burn.  Add oats; saute, stirring constantly, until golden -- about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; cool.    
Meanwhile, sift flour with cinnamon, salt, and soda; set aside.    
In large bowl, combine sugar, egg, and vanilla.  With wooden spoon, or portable electric mixer at medium speed, beat until light.    
Stir in rolled oats and flour mixture until well combined.    
Drop by slightly rounded teaspoonfuls, 3 inches apart, onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden.  Remove to wire rack. Cool.
