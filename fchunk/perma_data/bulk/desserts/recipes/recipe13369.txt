Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.    
Combine sweetener and margarine in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs one a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Beat in 2 cups flour and creamer. Add goat milk and vanilla extract; beat well.    
Mix remaining 2 cups flour with baking powder and salt in a bowl. Add to the sweetener mixture; mix well until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.    
Cool in the pan for 20 minutes per inverting onto a cake dish. Drizzle honey on top.
