Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.    
Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat eggs in, one at a time, until combined; stir in vanilla extract. Fold in flour mixture until well blended.    
Combine figs, honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a food processor; pulse until smooth. Stir in lemon juice until filling is slightly thinner than jam.    
Shape dough into 1-inch balls; place on a non-stick baking sheet. Make thumbprints in batter with a wet finger. Spoon 1 teaspoon of filling into each thumbprint.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
