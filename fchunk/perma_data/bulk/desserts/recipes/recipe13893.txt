Cream butter, Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt and dark brown sugar in a bowl for 5 minutes with an electric mixer on high speed. Add flour and mix on low speed until just combined.    
Scrape dough onto a sheet of parchment paper; shape into a log about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap with the parchment paper. Refrigerate until chilled completely, about an hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil cookie sheets.    
Remove dough from parchment and roll in demerara sugar to coat. Slice into rounds 1/4 inch thick and place on cookie sheets.    
Sprinkle each cookie with additional demerara sugar and a pinch of Diamond Crystal(R) Coarse Sea Salt.    
Bake until very lightly browned and firm to the touch, about 8 to 10 minutes.
