Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a blender or food processor, combine tofu, sugar, vanilla, salt, vegetable oil, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth. Pour into the pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool. Refrigerate until chilled.
