Place waffle on a work surface or plate; add ice cream. Spoon peanut butter and chocolate syrup over ice cream. Fold waffle around fillings creating a "taco" shape.    
Pour enough chocolate shell over "taco" so the filling is completely covered and sealed in; top with peanuts. Allow shell to harden.
