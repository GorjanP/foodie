Melt condensed milk, chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir frequently until smooth, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; add almond extract, stirring until well mixed. Let cool in pan until no longer hot, 5 to 10 minutes. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.    
Fill a small bowl with confectioners' sugar.    
Remove chocolate mixture from the refrigerator and roll into quarter-size balls. Drop truffles gently into the bowl of sugar and roll until well coated.
