Warm the wine  and oil over medium heat.  Remove from heat and add  12 cups of flour.  Stir in water, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together in a soft ball. Knead well.    
Roll the dough into a snake and cut into two inch  pieces.  Run each piece over a basket or use a fork to get ridges in the dough.    
Heat  oil for frying in a large pot.  Deep fry cookies until medium brown.  Drain on paper towels.    
Warm honey in a frying pan until very liquid.  Roll the cookies in the honey, and then place in a dish.  Allow the honey to cool and serve.
