Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line muffin cups with paper liners.    
Mix yellow cake mix, pumpkin pie mix, eggs, and 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl until batter is well mixed. Fill muffin cups, about 1/4 cup per cupcake, with batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool cupcakes in tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl using an electric mixer until frosting is fluffy; spoon onto each cupcake.
