Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.  Make the topping by mixing together 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, chopped walnuts and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Set aside.    
In large bowl, mix together 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, flour, salt, baking soda and cinnamon.  Make a well in the center, and pour in the oil, eggs and sour milk.  Beat until smooth, then fold in chopped apples.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with topping mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
