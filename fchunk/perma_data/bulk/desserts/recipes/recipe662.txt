Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and grease an 8 inch square baking dish.    
Place the peaches in the bottom of the baking dish, and sprinkle them with almond extract.    
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles crumbs.    
Sprinkle the flour mixture in an even layer over the top of the peaches, and bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the peaches are bubbling and the topping is browned.
