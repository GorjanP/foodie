Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Mix brown sugar, chocolate-hazelnut spread, chocolate chips, egg, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Drop rounded teaspoons of mixture, at least 1 1/2-inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are puffed and cracked, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet until firm, about 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
