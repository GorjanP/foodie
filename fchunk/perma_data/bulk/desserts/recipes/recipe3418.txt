Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
Cream together shortening, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in zucchini, raisins, and walnuts. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Cool on the cookie sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
