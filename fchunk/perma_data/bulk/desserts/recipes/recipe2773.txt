Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the oats, flour, cinnamon, and vanilla. Fold in the applesauce and walnuts. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan.    
Bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool in pan, and cut into squares.
