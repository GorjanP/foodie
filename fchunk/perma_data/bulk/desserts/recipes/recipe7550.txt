Cover baking sheets with wax paper and set aside.    
Combine sugar and cocoa in a large saucepan.  Stir in milk, butter and peanut butter.  Cook and stir over medium heat until butter melts and mixture is combined, about 5-20 minutes.  Remove from heat.    
Stir in the vanilla, oats and nuts, and mix thoroughly.  Take a teaspoon and scoop out a spoonful of the mixture; drop the spoonful onto the waxed paper-covered baking sheet.  Repeat with the rest of the mixture.  Place in the refrigerator until the cookies are cooled and set.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.
