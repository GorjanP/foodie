Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Arrange bananas onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle brown sugar, lemon juice, honey, and orange juice over the bananas; cover with aluminum foil.    
Bake for 5 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.
