In a medium saucepan, combine mango slices and juice, mixed fruit and rum. Add cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir gently on medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until completely cool. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x4 inch loaf pan. Mix together the flour and baking powder; set aside.    
In a large bowl, combine fruit mixture with egg and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture. Pour into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
