In a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in sugar and cinnamon and heat until bubbly. Peel and quarter the banana. Place banana pieces and lemon juice in skillet and cook 3 to 4 minutes more, basting with  syrup.    
In a long-handled pan, heat rum and banana liqueur over medium heat until just warm.  Ignite the alcohol and pour carefully over the banana slices.  Remove the banana pan from the heat and continue to baste the banana slices with their sauce until the flames die down.  Serve at once.
