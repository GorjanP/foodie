In a 1 quart saucepan, stir together sugar, cornstarch and salt.  Place over medium-low heat and stir in eggs and milk.  Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Stir in vanilla and butter.  Let cool briefly and serve warm, or chill in refrigerator until serving.
