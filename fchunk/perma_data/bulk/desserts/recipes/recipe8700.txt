Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Press pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie pan.    
Combine crushed pineapple, sugar, coconut, margarine, eggs, and flour in a bowl; mix with a fork until well blended. Pour into pie crust pastry.    
Bake pie in the preheated oven until the middle is set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
