Add the saffron to the warm milk and set aside for 15 minutes.    
Combine the softened ice cream, saffron with milk, rose syrup, cardamom, and pistachios in a large bowl. Stir until the ice cream is smooth and pink in color. Scoop the ice cream back into the container and freeze 2 hours, or until ready to eat.
