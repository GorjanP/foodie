In a large bowl combine cake mix, whipped topping and egg; mix until well combined. Chill the dough several hours or overnight (or freeze dough wrapped in plastic).    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Form tablespoons of dough into one inch balls and roll them in the confectioners' sugar.  Place the cookies on greased or parchment lined cookie sheet a couple inches apart.    
Bake 10 to 12 minutes until cookies are set, but not browned.  Cool on wire rack.
