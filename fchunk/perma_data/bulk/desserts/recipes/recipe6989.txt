Place cottage cheese in strainer and let drain for about 1 hour or until most of liquid has been drained.    
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, combine cottage cheese, sugar, flour, lemon juice, salt, egg yolks, evaporated milk, and regular milk. Mix well.    
In a separate clean bowl, beat egg whites until firm. Fold into batter until smooth. Pour into pie crusts.    
Bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), then reduce oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.    
Cool on racks, then refrigerate. Flavor improves if served a day after baking.
