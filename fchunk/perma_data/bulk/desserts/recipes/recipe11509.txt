Puree strawberries and honey in a food processor until smooth.    
Slowly whisk milk and peanut butter together in a bowl until smooth; add vanilla and stir. Spoon the peanut butter mixture evenly into the bottoms of 12 silicon muffin cups; top each with a portion of the strawberry puree.    
Put 'cups' in freezer until frozen through, about 4 hours.
