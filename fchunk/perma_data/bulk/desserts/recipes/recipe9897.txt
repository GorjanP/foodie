Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Beat in the egg until well blended then stir in the flour.  Roll the dough into small balls. Roll each ball in egg white then roll in chopped nuts to coat. Place cookies onto the prepared cookie sheet and make an indention in the center with your finger.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges turn golden. While cookies  are hot press a chocolate kiss into the center indention. Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
