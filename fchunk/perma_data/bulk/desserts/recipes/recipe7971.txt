Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Spread coconut flakes onto an ungreased baking sheet.    
Bake coconut in the preheated oven, stirring every 3 to 5 minutes, until toasted, about 10 minutes.    
Mix sweetened condensed milk, flour, corn syrup, brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; fold in toasted coconut. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and slightly browned, 25 to 35 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.    
Heat chocolate chips and milk in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Stir in confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until frosting is smooth, 2 to 4 minutes. Spread frosting over bars. Refrigerate 30 minutes before cutting.
