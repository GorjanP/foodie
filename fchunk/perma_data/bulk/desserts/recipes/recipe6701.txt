In a heavy frying pan, heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Set aside.    
Whisk together the eggs, milk and lemon extract.  Fold in the flour mixture, stirring until well blended.  In a separate bowl, sift together the confectioner's sugar and cinnamon.  Set aside.    
Blocking the spout with your finger, fill the funnel with 3/4 cup of the batter.  Place your hand over the hot oil and carefully remove your finger.  Scribble and criss-cross the batter  into the oil, then fry until golden on both sides.  Using a slotted spatula, lift the funnel cake out of the oil and drain on paper towels.  Repeat this procedure with the remaining batter, and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar mixture while still warm.
