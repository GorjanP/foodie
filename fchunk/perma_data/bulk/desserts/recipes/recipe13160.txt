Sift flour and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl.    
Mix butter and milk caramel jam together in a separate bowl using a fork. Beat until smooth with an electric mixer. Beat in egg yolks and rum. Mix in sifted mixture gradually until well blended. Refrigerate dough, about 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.    
Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut into shapes using cookie cutters. Arrange cookies on the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until firm to the touch, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
