Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9 inch layer pans.    
Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa, and sugar into a large bowl. Stir in mayonnaise. Gradually add water and vanilla and blend until smooth.  Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cool, remove from pans, and frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.
