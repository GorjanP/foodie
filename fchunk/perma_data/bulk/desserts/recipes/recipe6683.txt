Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (125 degrees C). Line baking sheets with brown paper.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, salt, and gelatin, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in vinegar and chocolate chips if desired. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, then turn the oven off and leave cookies in for an additional 20 minutes or until they dry out.  Cool completely before removing from the paper.
