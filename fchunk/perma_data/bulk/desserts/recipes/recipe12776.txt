Combine pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and cloves in a large pot over low heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until pumpkin is very soft, about 30 minutes. Mix in coconut and remove from heat. Mash large pumpkin pieces with a potato mash, or leave them slightly chunky. Let cool for 10 minutes.    
Transfer  to a container with a lid and refrigerate.
