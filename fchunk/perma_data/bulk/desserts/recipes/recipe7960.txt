Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat egg yolks, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and orange extract together in another bowl. Add egg yolk mixture to butter mixture; beat well.    
Sift flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is well-blended. Roll dough into walnut-size balls and place on prepared baking sheets. Press dough balls to slightly flatten.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges and set, 8 to 10 minutes.
