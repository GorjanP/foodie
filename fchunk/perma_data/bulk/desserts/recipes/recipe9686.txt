Place ricotta cheese in strainer.  Drain for about 1 hour, or until most of liquid has been discarded.    
Combine ricotta, sugar, flour, lemon juice, salt, egg yolks, evaporated milk, and milk in a large bowl; mix well.    
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until firm.  Fold into batter until smooth.  Divide filling into pie crusts.    
Bake pies for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).  Reduce oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool on wire racks.  Refrigerate.
