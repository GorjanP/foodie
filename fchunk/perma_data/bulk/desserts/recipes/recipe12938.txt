Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cake pan; line bottom with parchment paper.    
Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup maple syrup, and butter in a large bowl. Press over the bottom and up the sides of the cake pan.    
Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add 1 cup maple syrup and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add heavy cream and vanilla extract; beat until just combined. Pour over the graham cracker crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until firm, 8 hours to overnight.
