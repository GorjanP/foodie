Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Pour cake mix into a large bowl. Stir in eggs, oil, and lemon extract until well blended. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough into a bowl of confectioners' sugar. Roll them around until they're lightly covered. Once sugared, put them on an ungreased cookie sheet.    
Bake for 6 to 9 minutes in the preheated oven. The  bottoms will be light brown, and the insides chewy.
