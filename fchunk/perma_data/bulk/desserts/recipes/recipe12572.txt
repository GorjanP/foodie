Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup orange juice and let stand.  Oil a 10 inch tube pan.    
Beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar.  Beat in lemon juice and remaining 1/2 cup orange juice.  Transfer to a small saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in gelatin mixture.    
Beat the egg whites with 3/4 cup sugar until stiff.  Fold hot custard into egg whites.  Fold in cake pieces and pineapple.  Pour mixture into prepared pan.  Place cherry halves with a spoon throughout the mixture.  Chill in refrigerator overnight.    
In a chilled bowl, whip cream, green food coloring and 2 tablespoons sugar with an electric mixer until stiff.  Serve unmolded dessert with whipped cream.
