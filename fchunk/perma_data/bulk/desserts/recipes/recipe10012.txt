Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch round pan.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the biscuit mix and 1/3 cup of sugar. Add the egg, oil, and milk, mix until smooth. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. In another bowl, stir together the chopped nuts, 1/4 cup of sugar and lemon zest. Sprinkle this mixture over the batter in the pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Serve warm.
