Mix butter or margarine with sugar until creamy.  Add salt, almond or vanilla extract, flour, and nuts.  Mix WELL.    
Chill dough until firm enough to handle.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Using fingers, shape dough into 1 inch balls or crescents.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until light brown.  While cookies are still warm, roll in  powdered sugar.  These keep well.
