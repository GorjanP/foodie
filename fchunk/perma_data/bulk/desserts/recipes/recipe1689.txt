Slit each banana lengthwise through the peel, making sure not to cut all the way through to the other side.  Stuff the bananas with marshmallows and chocolate chips.    
Wrap each banana in aluminum foil and cook over a fire, on the barbecue, or in a 300 degree oven for 5 minutes, or until chocolate is melted.  Eat with a spoon.
