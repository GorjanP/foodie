In a medium bowl, beat egg whites with salt until foamy.  Gradually pour in 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.    
Bring milk to a simmer in large saucepan over medium heat.  Drop egg white mixture in six separate mounds into simmering milk, leaving one inch between mounds.  Poach 3 to 5 minutes, turning once.  Remove meringues with slotted spoon and drain.  Remove milk from heat and set aside.    
Beat eggs and egg yolks in a large bowl.  Beat in 1/2 cup sugar.  Stir in milk from the saucepan.    
Cook milk mixture in a double boiler over simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Let cool before stirring in vanilla.    
To serve, pour custard in a dish and top with poached meringues.
