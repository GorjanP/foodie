Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cake mix, dried cranberries, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a bowl until dough is smooth. Drop 1 to 2 tablespoons batter per cookie onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 6 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for about 5 minutes; transfer to a sheet of waxed paper to cool completely.
