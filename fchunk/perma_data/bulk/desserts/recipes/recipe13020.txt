Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine cake mix, pudding mix, and cornstarch in a large bowl. Mix in oil and 1/4 cup water. Add additional water until batter is moist. Mix in chocolate chips.    
Roll batter into balls and arrange on baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tops split, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
