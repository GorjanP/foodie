Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Mix applesauce, coconut, cranberries, oats, flour, egg whites, honey, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until well combined. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
