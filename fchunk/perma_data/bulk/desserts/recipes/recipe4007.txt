Cream together confectioner's sugar and butter.  Add vanilla, cinnamon and almonds.    
Knead in flour by hand until completely mixed.    
Chill dough for about an hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.    
Roll out dough to one inch thickness.  Cut into 1 inch pieces, and roll quickly and gently into a ball.   Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.  Bake for about 15 minutes.    
When baked, dip or roll in confectioner's sugar.  Store airtight in layers with waxed paper in between.
