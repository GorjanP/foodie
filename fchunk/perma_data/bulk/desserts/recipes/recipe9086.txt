Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 inch round pan.    
In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter. Stir until smooth and remove from heat.    
In a separate bowl over boiling water, whisk the eggs and sugar until light and lemon colored. Remove from heat and fold in the flour. Mix 1/4 of the egg mixture into the chocolate. Pour remaining egg mixture into chocolate and quickly fold until no streaks remain. Pour into prepared pan.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes. The cake will be soft and appear under-baked. Allow to cool before removing from pan.
