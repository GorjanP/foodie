Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs until well blended. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. Fold in the walnuts, oats and apples. Drop dough by spoonfuls about 2 inches onto ungreased cookie sheets.
