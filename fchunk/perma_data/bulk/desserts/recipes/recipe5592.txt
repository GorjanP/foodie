Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch round tube pan.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, add to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk. Stir until just blended, then pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Cake is done when a toothpick inserted, comes out clean. Cool before removing from pan.
