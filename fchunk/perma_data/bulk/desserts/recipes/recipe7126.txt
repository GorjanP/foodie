Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spread the coconut onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Mix the coconut and 1/2 cup melted butter in a bowl, and chill until it begins to firm, about 15 minutes. Pat the coconut mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Chill until set, at least 30 minutes.    
Place sugar, 1/2 cup of butter, lemon juice, eggs, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Place over low heat, and whisk constantly until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Do not boil. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, and stir in the lemon zest. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the custard, and chill thoroughly.    
Spoon the lemon custard into the coconut crust, and top with fresh raspberries.
