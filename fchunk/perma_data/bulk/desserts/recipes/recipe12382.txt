Spray the pudgy pie pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Evenly spread one side of each slice of bread with softened butter. Lay a slice of bread, butter side down, into the toaster.  Spoon on pie filling, top with raisins and second slice of bread, butter side up.    
Close up toaster, and cook over a hot campfire, turning occasionally, until the pie is hot and golden brown, about 4 minutes.
