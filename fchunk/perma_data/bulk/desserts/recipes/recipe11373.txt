Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Cream butter and sugar until smooth.  Add the milk and eggs, stirring well. Set aside 1/4 cup of the flour.  Sift the rest with baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Sprinkle on the grated orange rind.  Stir into the butter mixture until well blended. In a separate bowl, mix together the currants, raisins, dates and nuts.  Toss together with 1/4 cup of flour.  Fold into the batter.    
Drop onto cookie sheets and bake for 23 to 25 minutes, until slightly golden.  Let cool on rack.
