In a large bowl, stir together peanut butter, powdered sugar, corn syrup, and powdered milk. Divide mixture into 15 to 20 portions, and refrigerate in individual plastic bags for at least 1 hour. Remove dough from plastic bags, and mold into shapes on waxed paper. Decorate with chocolate chips, if desired.
