Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease a 9 inch square baking pan.    
To make crust:  In a large bowl, cream shortening, white sugar and brown sugar.  Separate egg and beat in yolk and vanilla, stirring until well blended.  Slowly add in the flour and blend well.  Mixture will be stiff.    
Press dough evenly into baking pan.  Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until top is golden brown.    
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat.  Spread the melted chocolate over warm crust. Sprinkle top with almonds. Let cool on wire rack before cutting.
