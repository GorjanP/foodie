Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 10x15 inch jelly roll pan.    
In a large bowl, beat eggs until fluffy.  Beat in sugar until fluffiness resumes.  Stir in pumpkin and lemon juice.  In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Fold dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture.  Spread in prepared pan; sprinkle with nuts.    
Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes.  Sprinkle a kitchen towel with confectioner's sugar.  Turn cake out onto towel while still hot.  Carefully roll cake in towel, long ends together, and let cool completely.    
To Make Filling:  In medium bowl, cream together cream cheese, butter and confectioners' sugar.  Stir in vanilla.    
Carefully unroll cooled cake and remove kitchen towel.  Spread cake with filling and re-roll.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.
