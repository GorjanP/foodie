Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the cored apples upright in a shallow baking dish.    
In a medium bowl, whip the egg white until it holds a stiff peak. Sprinkle in the sugar, and whip just a bit more. Stir in the cinnamon, raisins, and toffee until evenly distributed. Spoon into the cores of the apples.    
Bake uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the meringue is crisped. Allow to cool slightly  before serving.
