Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Separate egg whites from yolks, and place in separate large bowls. Use an electric mixer to beat egg whites until stiff.    
To the yolks, add the brown sugar, butter, flour, and milk; beat well. Fold egg whites into the batter; pour into the pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly browned, about 45 minutes.
