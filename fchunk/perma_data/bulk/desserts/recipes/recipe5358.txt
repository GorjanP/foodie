In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar.  Beat in egg, heavy cream, and vanilla.    
Slowly add in flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix until well blended.  If dough seems too dry, add in water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.    
Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.    
Roll out dough on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 of an inch.  Cut with cookie cutters and place 1 1/2 inches apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly colored.
