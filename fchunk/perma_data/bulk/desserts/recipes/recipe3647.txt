Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Blend the white sugar and shortening until light. Beat in the eggs, milk, vanilla and 1 teaspoon lemon extract. Mix until well blended.    
Combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture. Mix until combined (the dough will be sticky). Drop spoonfuls of dough onto parchment paper lined baking sheets.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool then frost with icing.    
To Make Icing: Combine the confectioners' sugar, water and lemon extract to taste. Beat until smooth and make icing thick enough to spread on cooled cookies
