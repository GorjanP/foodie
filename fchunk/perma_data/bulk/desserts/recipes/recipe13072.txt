Place almonds in a heat-proof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand for a few minutes until cool enough to handle. Slip the almonds out of their skins one by one, leaving the remaining almonds in the warm water. Drain almonds in a colander and pat dry with paper towels.    
Place almonds, confectioners' sugar, rose water, and almond extract in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process to a paste. Scrape the sides a few times to ensure even processing. Process marzipan until it is smooth and no longer grainy. Wrap in plastic wrap and store marzipan in a cool, dry place, 8 hours to overnight.    
Shape marzipan into a 1/2-inch thick roll. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Dredge balls in cocoa.
