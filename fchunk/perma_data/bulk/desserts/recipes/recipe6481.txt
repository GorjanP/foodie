Grease 3 - 13 x 9 inch pans.  Line with wax paper.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Combine almond paste, sugar, butter, egg yolks and almond extract.  Beat for 5 minutes until light and fluffy. Beat in flour and salt.    
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  With a wooden spoon, fold into the almond mixture.    
Divide dough into 3 -1 1/2 cup portions.  Add red coloring to one of the portions, and green to the another. Spread the batter in the 3 separate prepared pans (keeping the colors separate).    
Bake for 15 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.  (Each layer will be 1/4 inch thick). Remove cakes from pan immediately.  Cool thoroughly.    
Stack layers in a 9 x 13 inch pan, spreading apricot jam between layers (no jam on top layer). Place second 9 x 13 inch pan on top and weigh down with two 5 pound bags of sugar or flour.  Refrigerate overnight.    
Melt chocolate over hot water and spread over cake.  Allow to set.  Trim edges and cup into 1 inch squares.
