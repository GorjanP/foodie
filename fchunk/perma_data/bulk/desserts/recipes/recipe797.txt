Place uncooked rice in a 3 quart saucepan, and add water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, combine beaten eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix well. Stir in rice and raisins.  Pour into a 10x6x2 inch baking dish.    
Bake uncovered for 30 minutes; stir pudding and sprinkle with nutmeg. Bake additional 30 minutes or until a knife inserted halfway between the edge and the center comes out clean.
