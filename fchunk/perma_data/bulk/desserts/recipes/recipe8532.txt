Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Whisk brown sugar, shortening, butter, molasses, eggs, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, cloves, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl until glossy; fold in flour until dough is just-combined.    
Pour coarse sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 48 balls. Roll balls in sugar and place 2-inches apart on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the cookies crack, about 9 minutes.
