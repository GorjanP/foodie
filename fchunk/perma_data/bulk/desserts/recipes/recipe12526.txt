Cream butter or margarine and sugar;  add eggs and vanilla.  Add dry ingredients to butter mixture.  Divide dough into 2 parts.    
Roll each part out, to approximate 1/8 inch thick, then spread with 1/2 of the peanut butter.  Roll up dough and refrigerate several hours.    
 Slice and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 5 - 8 minutes, until slightly brown.
