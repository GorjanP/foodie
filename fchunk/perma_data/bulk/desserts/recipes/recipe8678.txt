Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper muffin liners.    
Mix the cake mix, buttermilk, molasses, vegetable oil, eggs, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in large bowl until just combined. Spoon the batter into a large resealable plastic bag, press out excess air, and seal the top of the bag. Snip a corner of the bag about 1/4-inch from the bottom. Pipe the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
