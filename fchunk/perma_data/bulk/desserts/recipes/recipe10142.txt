Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch square pan.    
In a small bowl, toss together the glaceed fruit and 1/4 cup of flour just enough to coat the fruit. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the orange juice concentrate, then the egg, and almond extract. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the flour coated fruit and the walnuts.    
Spread the batter evenly in the prepared 9x9 inch pan. Bake for 20 minutes, or until bars start to pull away from the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven and cool before frosting.    
To make the frosting, combine the confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons of butter, and orange juice in a small bowl. Beat until light and fluffy. Spread over cooled bars , then cut into squares.
