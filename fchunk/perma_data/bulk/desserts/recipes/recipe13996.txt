Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spray cut sides of pumpkin with cooking spray. Place cut-side down on a rimmed baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Let cool, about 20 minutes.    
Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
Scoop cooked pumpkin into a bowl. Add sugar, applesauce, coconut milk, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and ground cloves; beat with an electric mixer until smooth.    
Divide pumpkin mixture among pie shells.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes more. Let cool completely on a wire rack, at least 1 hour.
