Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two cookie sheets.    
Cream the margarine together with the white sugar and brown sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until thoroughly blended. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts.    
Stir the flour, baking soda, salt, and rolled oats together in a mixing bowl until well blended. Stir the flour mixture into the sugar mixture. Mix in the coconut, white chocolate, and macadamia nuts until evenly blended. Drop by tablespoonfuls 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until centers are set and edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool 3 minutes on baking sheets before removing to cool on a rack.
