Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Stir in the white sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup and vanilla. Mix in the pecans, chocolate chips, coconut and raisins. Pour into pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 90 minutes, or until golden brown and a knife inserted comes out clean.
