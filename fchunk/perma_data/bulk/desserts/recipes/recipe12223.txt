Heat chocolate bars, chocolate chips, and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.    
Remove chocolate mixture from heat; stir in walnuts, marshmallows, and vanilla until completely coated. Spread mixture into 9x13-inch baking pan, gently pressing down with spatula to evenly flatten out. Refrigerate until hardened, 4 to 5 hours.
