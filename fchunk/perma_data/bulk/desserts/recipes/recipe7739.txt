Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round pans. Sift flour, baking soda and salt together 3 times and set aside.    
In a small saucepan, heat water, chocolate and 1/2 cup sugar, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.    
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each egg.  Add half of flour mixture and beat until smooth. Add milk and remaining flour mixture alternately in 2 parts. Beat smooth after each addition.   Add vanilla and chocolate mixture. Blend well.    
Divide batter into two 9 inch pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
