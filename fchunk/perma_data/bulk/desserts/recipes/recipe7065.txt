Pour 1 cup of milk into a bowl, and stir in pudding mix.  Beat with an electric mixer about 2 minutes until thickened.  Place the remaining milk and raspberries into a blender and puree until smooth.    
Pour the raspberry puree into the pudding, and add the whipped topping.  Stir together until incorporated.  Stir in the softened sherbet.  You may either mix it in completely, or leave it swirled.    
Divide this mixture evenly among 10 molds or small plastic cups.  Place a wooden craft stick into each, and freeze for at least 3 hours.
