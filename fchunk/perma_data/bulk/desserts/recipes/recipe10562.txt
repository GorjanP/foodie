Mix whipped topping, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until blended.    
Place cream cheese pieces on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave at 30-second intervals until warm and soft, but not discolored, about 1 minute.    
Mix cream cheese into whipped topping mixture; beat with an electric bender on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Pour into graham cracker crust, smoothing the top.    
Refrigerate cheesecake until set, 4 to 5 hours.
