Sift flour into large mixing bowl.  Resift with salt, soda, baking powder and   cinnamon. In a separate bowl, cream the butter or margarine  with sugar until fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time and mix well. Add butter mixture to dry ingredients alternately with sour cream,  mixing until smooth after each addition. Add vanilla.  Wrap dough in waxed paper and chill  until firm enough   to roll, about 2 hours.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F 150 degrees C.  Roll dough on floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Cut with large cookie cutter; place on ungreased cookie  sheet.    
Sprinkle with sugar and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned.
