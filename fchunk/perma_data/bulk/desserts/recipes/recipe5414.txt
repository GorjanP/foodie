Pour cream soda into a bowl and whisk until no longer bubbly; set aside.    
Heat water and sugar in a saucepan over medium high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.    
Stir sugar mixture and vanilla extract into the cream soda.    
Pour mixture into small plastic cups or ice pop molds, then insert wooden ice pop sticks. Freeze until firm.
