Spread almonds in a large skillet; toast over medium heat until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour almonds into a bowl.    
Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides to avoid scorching, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; pour in almonds and stir until evenly coated.    
Drop spoonfuls of chocolate-almond mixture onto a plate lined with waxed paper.    
Chill until set, about 10 minutes.
