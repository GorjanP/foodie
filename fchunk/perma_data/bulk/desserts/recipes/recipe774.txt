Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and vanilla.  Beat until the whites form soft peaks.  Slowly add sugar; beat until stiff peaks form, and mixture becomes glossy.  Fold in cocoa and chocolate chips.    
Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls on to a greased cookie sheet.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
