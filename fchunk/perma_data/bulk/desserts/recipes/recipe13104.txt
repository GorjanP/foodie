Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Spread apple slices into an 8-inch square pan.    
Mix brown sugar, flour, margarine, oats, walnuts, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Sprinkle topping over the apples.    
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and apples are tender, about 30 minutes.
