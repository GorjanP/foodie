Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add squash, cover, and steam until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Blend squash in a blender until smooth. Pour 6 cups squash puree into a large mixing bowl. Reserve any extra squash puree for a separate use.    
Stir cream, honey, eggs, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, allspice, and nutmeg into 6 cups squash puree; whisk until smooth. Cover and set aside.    
Mix flour and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture; add water and mix well. Add more flour to dough if it is too wet. Cut dough in half and roll onto a floured work surface; form into two 10-inch circles. Press dough into 2 pie pans and pour squash filling into each.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.
