Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Beat cake mix, 1 1/4 cup water, vegetable oil, and egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer in medium speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 29 to 34 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.    
Stir pineapple-flavored gelatin with boiling water in a bowl until dissolved; stir in cold water.    
Poke holes into cake using a skewer or straw; spoon gelatin mixture evenly over cake. Refrigerate for 4 hours.    
Mix pineapple and pudding mix in a bowl; fold in whipped topping. Spread mixture evenly over chilled cake; refrigerate at least 2 more hours.
