Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a tube pan.    
Beat white sugar, 1 cup margarine, and shortening together with an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Mix flour, 6 fluid ounces citrus-flavored soda, eggs, lemon extract, and vanilla extract into the creamed mixture until well incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared tube pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cake cool for 10 minutes before turning cake onto a serving plate.    
Whisk confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons melted margarine, and 1 fluid ounce citrus-flavored soda together in a bowl until smooth; spread over cake.
