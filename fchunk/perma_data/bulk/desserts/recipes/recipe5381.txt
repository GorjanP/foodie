Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat shortening, almond butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a bowl until smooth. Combine hot water, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl; stir into almond butter mixture until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until blended. Gradually stir in flour until dough is just blended.    
Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Press and flatten balls with a fork to create a crosshatch pattern.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes.
