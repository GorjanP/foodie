Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of tart pan with a removable bottom and line with parchment paper.    
Mix almond meal, oat flour, and baking powder together in a bowl.    
Whisk egg, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla extract, salt, and almond extract together in another bowl. Fold in almond meal mixture to form a sticky dough.    
Press dough into the prepared tart pan. Arrange pears on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 22 to 25 minutes.
