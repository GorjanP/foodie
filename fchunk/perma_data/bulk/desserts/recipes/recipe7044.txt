Combine the cream, water, sugar, and gelatin in a saucepan over low heat.  Stir constantly until the gelatin has dissolved.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly until thickened, about 10 minutes; it should be the consistency of beaten eggs. Fold in the sour cream, vanilla extract, and almond extract.  Pour into a mold, cover, and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.    
Loosen from mold by dipping into hot water.  Invert onto a serving plate to unmold.  Pour lingonberries over top.
