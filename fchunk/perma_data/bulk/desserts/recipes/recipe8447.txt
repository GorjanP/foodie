Place white sugar, brown sugar, butter, milk, and carob powder in a large pan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil.  Boil for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.    
Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in macadamia nut butter until dissolved.  Stir in oatmeal until well incorporated.  Drop onto a waxed paper lined cookie sheet, and place in the refrigerator to cool.
