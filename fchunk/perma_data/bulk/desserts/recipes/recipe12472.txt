Place packaged popcorn in the microwave; cook on high until popping begins to slow down, about 2 1/2 minutes. Pour popcorn into a large bowl. Remove any unpopped kernels.    
Place almond bark in a saucepan and melt over medium-low heat, stirring constantly so it does not burn on the bottom, about 8 minutes. Pour melted almond bark over popcorn and stir to coat evenly. Pour out onto a baking sheet to cool.
