Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Melt 1 bar white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.    
Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Mix in the melted white chocolate, egg, green tea powder, and vanilla extract until creamy. Pour into the graham cracker pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center jiggles evenly when cake is lightly shaken, about 25 minutes. Let tart cool, about 30 minutes.    
Bring heavy cream to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in 1/2 bar white chocolate until smooth. Stir in corn syrup and water, in that order. Pour glaze onto the tart; tilt and rotate so glaze coats top evenly. Let rest until glaze is set, at least 15 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
