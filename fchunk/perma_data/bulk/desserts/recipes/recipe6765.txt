In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin onto cold water; let stand 1 minute to soften. Stir in boiling water until gelatin is completely dissolved. It must be in liquid form when you add it to the pie filling. If it stiffens up, microwave for about 10 to 15 seconds, and then stir until lump free.    
In a large bowl, combine sugar, cocoa, and pudding mix. Stir in 2 cups cream, vanilla, and 1 teaspoon rum extract. Beat for 30 seconds with an electric mixer on low, then beat on high until stiff peaks form. Gradually mix in gelatin mixture until blended. Pour filling into pie crust.    
In a small, chilled bowl, beat 1 cup cream with confectioners' sugar and 2 teaspoons rum extract until stiff peaks form. Spread over chocolate filling. Chill at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.
