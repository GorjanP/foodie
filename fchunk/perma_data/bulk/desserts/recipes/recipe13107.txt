Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a baking sheet.    
Combine apple pie filling, ginger, and cream cheese in a bowl; mix filling thoroughly.    
Roll out each biscuit; add 3 tablespoons filling on 1 side of each. Fold the other side of the biscuit over the filling. Place pockets on the prepared sheet.    
Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
