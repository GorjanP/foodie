In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder. Make a well in the center, and pour in melted chocolate, coffee, sour cream, and oil. Mix well, and spread into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes, then remove from pan.
