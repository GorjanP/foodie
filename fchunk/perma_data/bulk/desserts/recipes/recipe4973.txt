In large mixing bowl, mix shortening, brown sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and banana until well blended.    
Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the banana mixture; stir until well blended. Stir in chopped nuts. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven.
