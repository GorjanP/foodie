Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch baking pans with cooking spray.    
Combine all-purpose flour, white sugar, whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.    
Stir mashed bananas, buttermilk, egg whites, applesauce, egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add gradually to the flour mixture, mixing until batter is just combined.    
Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 30 minutes.    
Combine cream cheese, peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until frosting is creamy.    
Run a rubber spatula around the edges of the cooled cakes. Grease a baking sheet lightly with cooking spray. Invert cake pans onto the baking sheet; tap bottoms lightly to release cakes.    
Spread frosting onto the cake layers. Stack layers; frost top and sides. Cut into 8 slices. Garnish with banana slices.
