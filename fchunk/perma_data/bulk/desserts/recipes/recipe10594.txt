Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Mix brown sugar, baking mix, eggs, pecans, margarine, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; spread into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until brown and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Cut into 2-inch squares.
