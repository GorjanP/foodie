Melt butter with brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in white sugar, baking soda, and salt. Let mixture cool for 15 minutes.    
Transfer butter mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add beaten eggs and vanilla extract; mix well. Fold in flour gently, 1 cup at a time, using a wooden spoon. Fold chocolate chips into the thick batter with the spoon.    
Refrigerate cookie dough for 1 hour or freeze for 30 minutes.    
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on ungreased, nonstick baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to turn golden, 8 to 9 minutes. Let cool.
