Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Mix oats, coconut, flour, and sugar in a bowl. Dissolve baking powder in boiling water in another bowl; stir in butter and golden syrup. Stir butter mixture into oat mixture until dough is well mixed. Drop level tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Flatten dough with a fork lightly coated with flour.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
