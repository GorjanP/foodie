Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Grease a cake pan.    
Beat white sugar and shortening together until light and fluffy.    
Beat eggs, one at a time, into sugar mixture until well mixed; stir in vanilla extract.    
Stir 1 cup strawberries and baking soda in a large bowl until baking soda is dissolved. This will help strawberries foam and rise in the cake.    
Whisk flour and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture and strawberry mixture by hand, into sugar mixture, alternating flour mixture, then strawberry mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture.    
Pour batter into prepared cake pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.    
Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, and 1/4 cup strawberries in a bowl with an electric mixer until blended; frost the cooled strawberry cake.
