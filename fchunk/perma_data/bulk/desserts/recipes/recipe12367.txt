Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart baking dish.    
Mix pears, cherries, cornstarch, 2/3 cup sugar, and almond extract in prepared baking dish. Combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl; cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle flour mixture over fruit.    
Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden, about 1 hour.
