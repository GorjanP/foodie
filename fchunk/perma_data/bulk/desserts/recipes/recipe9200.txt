In a large bowl beat together eggs and sugar until thick and light colored. Then beat in shortening, brandy, anise seeds (optional) and salt.  Beat in flour gradually.    
On a floured surface, knead dough into a smooth ball. Divide ball into two equal pieces, wrap in waxed paper and chill in refrigerator for at least two hours.    
Roll one piece of dough into a rectangle approximately 12 x 15 inches. (The other piece of dough should be left in refrigerator until ready to be rolled.) Using pastry wheel, cut dough into strips 6 x 1 inch.    
Make a vertical slit in top 1/3 of the strip and draw the bottom end of it through OR tie a knot in the center.  Repeat with remaining dough and set aside.    
Heat oil in a deep frying pan to 360 degrees F (185 degrees C).   Deep fry strips until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, cool, and sprinkle heavily with confectioners'  sugar.
