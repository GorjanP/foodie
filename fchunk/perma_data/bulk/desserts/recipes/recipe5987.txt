In a large bowl, soak the barley in the water overnight; do not drain.    
In a large saucepan over low heat, simmer the barley for one hour. Then add the sugar, raspberries and raisins and simmer for another 30 minutes. Add the cherries and simmer for another 15 minutes, or until the soup becomes relatively thick. Allow to chill in the refrigerator and serve cold.
