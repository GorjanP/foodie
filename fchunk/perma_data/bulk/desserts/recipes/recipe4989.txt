Combine 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, lemon peel and juice, and egg yolks in a saucepan.  Beat well.  Stir while cooking over medium heat until thick; it will thicken just as it starts to simmer.    
Remove saucepan from heat.  Add cream cheese to lemon mixture, and stir until incorporated.    
In a small bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; add remaining 1/4 cup sugar.  Fold sweetened egg whites into lemon mixture.    
Spoon filling into shell and chill.
