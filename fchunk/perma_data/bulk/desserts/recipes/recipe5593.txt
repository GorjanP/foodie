In a microwave safe bowl, combine marshmallows, chocolate bars and 1/3 cup of cream. Microwave on high, stirring occasionally, until everything is melted and smooth.    
In a medium bowl, whip remaining cream until it is light and fluffy. Fold into chocolate mixture. Spread entire mixture into graham cracker crust; cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.
