Combine the peach, strawberries, apple, cantaloupe, and honeydew in a blender; blend until only slightly chunky, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour in the cream of coconut, nutmeg, honey, and lime juice; blend until smooth.    
Divide the mixture evenly between 8 bowls. Top each bowl with a few blueberries and serve cold.
