Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a pie plate with 1 of the prepared pie pastries.    
Whisk brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Stir reserved peach liquid, water, and melted butter into sugar mixture until sugar dissolves into liquid. Stir in peaches.    
Spoon peach mixture into prepared pie plate and place remaining pie pastry over the top; pinch and crimp edges together. Dot with butter pieces, remaining sugar, and remaining cinnamon.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is light brown, about 45 minutes.
