Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Beat butter in a large bowl until creamy and fluffy. Mix flour, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract into the creamed butter to form a dough. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Press the dough balls with the bottom of a glass until dough is flattened to 1/2-inch thick.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are light brown, 10 to 13 minutes.
