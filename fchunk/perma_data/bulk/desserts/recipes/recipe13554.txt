Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Combine durian and heavy cream in a saucepan over low heat; heat until durian is softened and no chunks remain, 5 to 10 minutes.    
Transfer durian mixture to a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add confectioners' sugar, butter, and cream cheese; beat together until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla extract. Add flour, cream of tartar, and salt; mix until dough is evenly combined.    
Spoon dough into a piping bag fitted with round tip. Pipe out small circles of dough onto the lined baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let rest on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool.
