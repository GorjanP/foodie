Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a small bowl, combine bread crumbs, brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and cloves.  Place half of the sliced apples in a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Top with half the bread crumb mixture.  Repeat layers.  Pour melted butter over all and cover with applesauce.  Combine remaining cinnamon with white sugar and sprinkle on top.    
Bake in preheated oven 1 hour, until apples are tender and mixture is bubbly.
