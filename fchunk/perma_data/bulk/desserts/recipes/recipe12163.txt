Blend yogurt, coconut milk, cocoa powder, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a blender until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds to 3/4 full. Fill remaining space in each mold with cherries, and push cherries down into cocoa mixture with a knife to evenly distribute. Freeze until solid, at least 8 hours.
