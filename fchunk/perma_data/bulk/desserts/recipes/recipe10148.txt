On a lightly floured surface, pat out each dough to a rectangle 6x5 inches. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 8- 3/4 inch strips. Place 1 strip of each color side by side. Place two more strips on top of those, alternating colors. Repeat until the checkerboard is 4 strips high. Use remaining strips to form a second rectangle. Wrap rectangles and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or until firm.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Unwrap the dough and slice crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Place 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
