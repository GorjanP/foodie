Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
To make the crust: combine flour, nuts, and brown sugar. Add melted butter, tossing to combine the ingredients. Spread the mixture in a 9x13 inch pan.    
Bake the crust at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until lightly browned.  Remove from pan and set aside to cool. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups crust mixture in a 9x13 inch pan. Reserve the remaining crust mixture.    
Filling: In large bowl combine strawberries, sugar and lemon juice. Fold whipped topping into the strawberry mixture. Carefully spoon filling over the cooled crust. Sprinkle the remaining crust mixture on top. Cover and freeze for 6 hours or until firm. (You will need a full 6 hours).
