Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate.    
Beat ricotta cheese into lightly beaten eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Stir pumpkin, brown sugar, evaporated milk, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and salt into the cheese mixture until smooth; pour into the pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
