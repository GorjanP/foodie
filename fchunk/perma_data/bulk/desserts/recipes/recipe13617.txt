Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Beat butter and 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.    
Mix vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt into butter mixture. Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour slowly, beating until just mixed. Fold in almonds; mix briefly until combined.    
Shape dough into tiny crescents and arrange on ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crescents are golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Roll cooled crescents in 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar.
