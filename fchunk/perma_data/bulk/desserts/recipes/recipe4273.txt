Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch pie pan.    
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the lemon and vanilla extracts.    
Pour mixture into the prepared pie pan, and bake for 35 minutes.  Cool cheesecake for 5 minutes.  Leave the oven on.    
To make the topping:    Combine the sour cream and sugar, mixing until smooth.  Spread topping evenly over the cheesecake.  Return cheesecake to oven for 10 minutes.  Cool completely, then top with the lemon curd.  Refrigerate before serving.
