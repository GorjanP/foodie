Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Melt butterscotch chips and butter in the top of a double boiler or in a bowl in the microwave. Stir until smooth. Remove from heat and whisk in flour, salt and pecans. Set aside.    
Separate crescent roll triangles. On greased cookie sheet, arrange crescent rolls overlapping edges to form a circle. Long pointed ends of each roll should point outwards. Spread 2 rounded teaspoons of butterscotch mixture on each triangle. Roll up triangles, beginning with pointed end of roll. Slash inside half of each roll.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until golden. Remove from oven and let cool.    
While rolls bake, melt remaining butterscotch morsels and corn syrup; mix well. Drizzle over cooled rolls.
