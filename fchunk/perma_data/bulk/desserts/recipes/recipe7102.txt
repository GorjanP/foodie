Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Press one of the pie crusts into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. Refrigerate the other crust until needed.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, orange zest and salt. Combine the rhubarb and pineapple; stir into the dry ingredients until evenly blended. Pour into the prepared pie crust. Place the remaining crust on top and crimp the edges to seal in the filling. Cut a few holes in the top pastry to vent steam.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and rhubarb is tender when pierced with a fork, 45 to 50 minutes.
