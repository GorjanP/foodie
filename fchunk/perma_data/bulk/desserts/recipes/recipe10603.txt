Place the bowl of an ice cream maker in the freezer until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.    
Chill half-and-half in the freezer, shaking every 10 minutes, until chilled but not frozen, about 30 minutes.    
Pour chilled half-and-half and pudding mix into a bowl and mix well with a whisk.    
Place frozen bowl of ice cream maker into the ice cream maker; add the stirring component and lid. Turn on the machine so the bowl is rotating. Pour pudding mixture into the machine through the hole in the lid.    
Allow ice cream to process in the ice cream maker until desired consistency is reached, about 30 minutes.
