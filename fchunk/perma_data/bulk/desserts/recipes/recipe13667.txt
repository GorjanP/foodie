Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a two 8-inch baking dishes.    
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix honey into creamed butter-egg mixture.    
Sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda into a separate bowl. Slowly mix flour mixture, alternating with the coffee, into honey mixture until batter is just mixed. Fold almonds and raisins into batter; add orange zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon into batter. Pour batter into the prepared baking dishes.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
