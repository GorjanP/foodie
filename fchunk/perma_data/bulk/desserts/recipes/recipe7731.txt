Line a 9 inch pie plate with pastry.  Trim and flute, but do not prick bottom.    
Combine the brown sugar and cream in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over low heat.  Cook stirring slowly for 10 minutes, or until thickened.  Remove from heat, and stir in 1/2 chopped nuts.   Cool.  Pour filling into prepared pie shell.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove pie from oven, and cool.  Filling will set when cold.
