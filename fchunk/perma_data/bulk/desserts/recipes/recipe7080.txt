Trim a small piece from the bottom of each fig so they stand up straight. Remove stems, and score a 1/4 inch "X" into the top of each fig. Set aside.    
In a bowl, beat whipping cream together with sour cream until stiff peaks form. (This can be done either by hand, or with an electric mixer.) Gently fold in 1/4 cup of honey and a pinch of salt. Cover, and refrigerate.    
Pour port into a small saucepan over medium high heat. Add cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, cloves, 1 tablespoon honey, vanilla extract, balsamic vinegar, and lemon and orange zests. Stir to dissolve honey and blend flavors. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for up to 30 minutes, or as time allows, being careful not to reduce liquid too much. Place figs upright in pan, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.    
To serve, place a spoonful of honey cream in the center of each plate. Arrange 3 figs around the cream, and drizzle with a small amount of poaching liquid. Tuck a sprig of mint into the slit on the top of each fig. Serve immediately.
