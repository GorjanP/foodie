Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch springform pan.    
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter and sugar until smooth. Mix in 1 egg, then stir in the baking powder and flour.  Knead together into dough. Press into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan.    
Mix together the quark, oil, 3/4 cup white sugar, vanilla sugar, and pudding mix in a large bowl until smooth. Blend in the egg yolks, egg, milk, and lemon juice; pour mixture into the prepared pan.    
Bake in preheated oven until the filling no longer moves when you shake the pan, about 1 hour.
