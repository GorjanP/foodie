Melt the butter or margarine over low heat.  Mix together in a large bowl 2-1/2 cups of the flour. Add sugar, baking powder, lemon rind and salt.  Make a depression in the middle.  Drop into it the eggs and the melted butter or margarine.  Mix with a wooden spoon and then with the hands until dough leaves the sides of the bowl. Add remaining 1/2 cup of flour as needed. Knead dough on floured surface until it isn't sticky anymore.    
Break off pieces of dough and roll into ropes about the size of a pencil. Cut into pieces 1/4 inch long.  Roll these pieces into little balls and set aside.    
In deep frying pan, heat oil about 2 inches deep.  Fry balls until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.    
In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring 1-1/2 cups of pure honey to a boil.  Let honey boil gently for about 3 minutes before adding little dough balls, stirring gently with wooden spoon until they are well-coated.    
Remove balls from honey with a slotted spoon and place in a deep dish or mound them on a platter.  Sprinkle surface evenly with nuts and multicolored sprinkles.  Cool.
