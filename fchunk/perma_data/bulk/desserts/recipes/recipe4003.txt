Spread caramel topping into pie crust.    
Beat milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes; let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in whipped topping and chopped candy bars. Spoon into crust.    
Freeze for 4 hours or until set. Before serving, let stand for 15 minutes so that pie can easily be cut. Store any leftovers in refrigerator.
