Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with parchment paper.    
Mix sugar and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir in peanut butter until well blended. Pour peanut butter mixture into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookie base is partly cooked, 8 minutes.    
Layer semisweet chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips, pecans, almonds, and coconut onto the cookie base. Slowly pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over the toppings.    
Bake in the preheated oven until coconut is slightly brown, about 30 minutes.    
Cool completely before removing cookie bars from pan. Peel away parchment paper and cut into small squares using a sharp knife.
