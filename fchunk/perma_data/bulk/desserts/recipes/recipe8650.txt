Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.    
Beat sugar, pureed strawberries, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add flour, mixing until just incorporated. Stir food coloring into strawberry batter until color is even. Divide batter into prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
