Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a  9x5 inch loaf pan.  Sift together flour, cocoa, and baking powder.    
Soak chopped apricots in boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain, and pat dry with paper towels.    
In a large mixing bowl, mix almond paste and sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture looks sandy. Beat in eggs one at a time; beat for 2 minutes after each addition. Continue beating for about 10 minutes; mixture should look thick and creamy.    
Mix in milk, and then flour mixture. Mix only to combine the dry with the wet ingredients. Do not overbeat. Fold in apricots, chocolate, crystallized ginger, and melted butter. Transfer batter  to prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour, until done. Cool for 10 minutes in pan. Remove from pan, and place on a wire rack to cool completely.
