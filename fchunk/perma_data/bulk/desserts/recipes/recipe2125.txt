Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, combine sugar, honey, oil, eggs and orange zest. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the orange juice, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
