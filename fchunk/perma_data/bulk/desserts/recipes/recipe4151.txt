Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Combine cake mix with sugar, cooking oil, and apricot nectar.  Beat for two minutes with mixer.  Add eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition.  Pour batter into pan.    
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a plate.    
In a small bowl, mix lemon juice with confectioners' sugar until you reach desired consistency.  Drizzle glaze over sides of warm cake.
