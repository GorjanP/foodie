In a medium bowl combine pudding mix and coffee granules. Add milk, and whisk until smooth. Fold in 1/3 of the whipped topping and pour mixture into crust. Refrigerate 30 minutes.    
Spread remaining whipped topping over pie filling and refrigerate an additional 2 to 3 hours. If garnish is desired, soften chocolate candy bar in microwave on low power for 30 seconds. Carefully make chocolate curls with a vegetable peeler. Sprinkle curls on top of pie before serving.
