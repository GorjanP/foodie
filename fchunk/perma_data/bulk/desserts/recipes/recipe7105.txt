Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a mixing bowl until smooth. Whisk in the vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and orange juice. Stir in the chocolate chips and the flour mixture until no dry lumps remain. Divide the cookie dough into two pieces. Form each piece into a roll about 3 inches wide and 12 inches long. Place the rolls, side by side, onto the prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls have started to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the rolls from the oven onto a rack. Let cool about 10 minutes until cool enough to handle; cut the mandelbrot into 1/2-inch thick slices. Return the cookies to the baking sheet and lay them flat.    
Return to the oven and bake until lightly golden, about 15 minutes more. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
