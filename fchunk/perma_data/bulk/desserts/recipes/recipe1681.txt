Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Stir in the oats, bananas, raisins and coconut, one at a time using a wooden spoon. Drop by rounded spoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
