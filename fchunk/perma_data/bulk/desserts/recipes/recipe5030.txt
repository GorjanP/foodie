In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and sugar.  Pour in milk, a little at a time, stirring to make a smooth batter.  Beat in eggs and lemon zest.    
Core and peel apples, then cut in wedges.  Cut each wedge crosswise into thin slices.  Toss apples in batter to coat.    
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil and butter.  Drop fritter mixture by spoonfuls into pan and cook, turning once, until golden brown.  Plate and sprinkle with sugar.  Serve warm.
