Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 4 ramekins with cooking spray.    
Place blueberries into a bowl. Add sugar, water, and cornstarch. Stir gently until well mixed, 30 seconds to 1 minutes.    
Divide the blueberries evenly among the ramekins, filling them about 3/4 to the top.    
Heat butter in a large, microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute.    
Stir lemon cake mix into the butter to combine; mixture will still be a little dry and lumpy. Scoop about 1/2 cup of the mixture into each ramekin. Spray tops lightly with cooking spray.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm.
