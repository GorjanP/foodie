Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch Bundt pan.    
Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, melted butter, eggs, milk and lemon juice. Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture, mix until well blended. Finally, stir in the walnuts and marmalade. Pour batter into the prepared Bundt cake pan.    
Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.
