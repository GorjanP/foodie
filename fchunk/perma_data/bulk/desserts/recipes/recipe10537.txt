Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons spelt flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl; stir well. Make a well in the center; add 1/3 cup grape molasses and tahini. Stir to combine. Roll small portions of dough between your palms into small balls, about 1/2 inch in diameter.    
Combine water and 1 tablespoon grape molasses in a small bowl or shallow dish. Place sesame seeds in a second bowl. Roll balls in the molasses; coat with sesame seeds. Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Flatten with the bottom of a glass.    
Bake in the preheated until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet.
