Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 or 10 inch tube or bundt pan.    
Combine the lemon cake mix, eggs, brown sugar, flaked coconut, 3/4 vegetable oil, 3/4 cup apricot nectar and the lemon extract. Beat with electric beaters for 4 minutes at medium speed. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes then turn cake out on to a serving dish and immediately pour glaze over still warm cake.    
To Make Glaze: Combine the confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons apricot nectar, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and enough lemon juice to give the glaze a liquid consistency. Mix until smooth and use immediately to pour over still warm cake.
