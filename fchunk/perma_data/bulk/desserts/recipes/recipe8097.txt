Combine eggs, sugar, cinnamon or nutmeg, vanilla, and salt. Add scalded milk a little at a time, so that you do not cook the eggs. When all is blended, pour into a 8 or 9 inch unbaked pie shell.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
