Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat the egg white until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Fold in the toasted almonds. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden and firm. When cookies are completely cool, they can be placed into plastic bags and frozen.
