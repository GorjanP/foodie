Put enough shortening in a deep skillet to fill about 1 1/2 inches and heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Mix milk, eggs, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; slowly add flour, while continually mixing, until batter is smooth. Transfer batter to a squeeze bottle or funnel. Working quickly, squeeze or funnel batter into the hot oil, starting in the center of the skillet and moving bottle or funnel in a spiral shape.    
Fry funnel cake in the hot oil until lightly browned, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer funnel cakes to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
