In a separate bowl, mix flour, nutmeg and baking powder. Set aside.    
In a small bowl, cream butter with the white sugar. In a separate small bowl, cream yolks and brown sugar until very light.    
In a very large bowl, combine the two sugar mixtures and blend well.

Add soaked fruit and fold in. Add nuts and fold in.    
In a clean medium bowl, whip egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold into batter until evenly distributed.    
Pour into prepared 10 inch tube pan. Place a pan of water in the bottom of the oven and bake for 4 to 5 hours at 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Ovens vary, so watch the baking time. Test cake with wooden pick. (May take longer than 5 hours).
