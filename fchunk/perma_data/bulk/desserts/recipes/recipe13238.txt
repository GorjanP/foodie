Combine 1/2 cup dates, almonds, vanilla extract, and salt in a high-speed blender; blend until smooth. Transfer to a plate. Spread almond mixture into a square approximately 4x6-inches in size. Place in the freezer until hardened, about 10 minutes.    
Blend remaining 1 cup dates in the blender until smooth.    
Remove almond mixture from freezer; spread blended dates evenly on top with oiled hands. Sprinkle peanuts onto fudge; push down gently with hands until peanuts stick to blended dates. Freeze in the freezer until bars are set, about 15 minutes.    
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.    
Remove bars from the freezer; cut into 5 pieces with a sharp knife. Dip bars in melted chocolate; place onto a plate to cool until hardened. Place into an airtight container; store in refrigerator.
