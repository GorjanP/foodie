Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x9-inch pan.    
In a large bowl, mix shortening and sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs, pineapple, 1/2 cup rum, and vanilla. Add flour, sugar, pudding mix, baking powder and salt; mix until fully incorporated. Stir in macadamia nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean, about 45 to 55 minutes.    
To make the glaze: Place water, butter, and 1/2 cup sugar in small sauce pan. Boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add 1/4 cup rum.    
While cake is still very warm, poke holes all over top of cake with toothpick. Slowly spoon glaze onto cake. Cake will be very moist. Let stand for at least 15 minutes to absorb glaze. Best served while still warm.
