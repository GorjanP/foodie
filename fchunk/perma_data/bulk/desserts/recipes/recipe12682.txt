Pour cold water into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin on top of water and allow it to soften for 5 minutes.    
In a medium saucepan, mix together 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and milk. Cook over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 5 minutes. Cool slightly. Stir in gelatin mixture and allow to cool completely.    
In a large glass or metal bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar. Continue to beat while gradually adding 1/2 cup sugar, until stiff peaks form. Fold in whipped topping, coconut, and almond extract.    
Pour cooled milk mixture into pastry shell. Top with meringue mixture. Refrigerate pie for at least 2 hours before serving.
