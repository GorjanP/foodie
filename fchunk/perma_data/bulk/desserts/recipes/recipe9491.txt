Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted cake pan.    
Beat cake mix, butter, eggnog, and pudding mix together in a bowl with an electric mixer until just moistened. Add eggs and nutmeg; beat until batter is smooth, about 4 minutes. Pour batter into prepared cake pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
