Heat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan.    
In one medium bowl, stir together four, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.  Next, stir in sugar, honey, oil, and coffee.  With an electric beater at medium speed, beat batter for two minutes; add egg, and beat for one minute longer. Pour into prepared pan.    
Bake until a cake tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.  Cool completely before serving, and then enjoy!
