Mix tea biscuits, butter, egg, cocoa powder, and white sugar together in a bowl to form a moist but stiff dough. Stir in chocolate-hazelnut spread.    
Transfer dough to a large piece of parchment paper. Shape into a log with your hands. Wrap parchment paper around the log, twisting ends shut.    
Chill until firm, 2 hours in the freezer or 5 hours in the refrigerator. Cut into slices with a sharp knife.
