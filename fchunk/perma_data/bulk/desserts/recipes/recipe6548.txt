Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Make crust mix according to package directions. Roll dough out so that it fits an 8 inch skillet or frying pan; make sure there is overhang.    
Place peaches into pastry lined pan. Sprinkle with sugar, salt and cinnamon. Dot with butter.  Fold the dough edges over towards center; leave a small space in center uncovered. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes until fruit is bubbly and crust is browned.
