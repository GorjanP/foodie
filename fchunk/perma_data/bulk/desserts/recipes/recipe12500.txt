Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with olive oil, and dust with zwieback crumbs.    
In a large bowl, combine remaining zwieback crumbs, 1/4 cup white sugar, chopped almonds, and olive oil. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 7 minutes; set aside to cool.    
Process cottage cheese in food processor until smooth, or press through a fine sieve. In a mixing bowl, combine cottage cheese, 1/2 cup white sugar, flour, salt, egg yolks, sour cream, lemon peel, and lemon juice. Beat at medium speed, scraping the bowl often, until smooth and well blended.    
In a clean mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup white sugar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cheese mixture. Fold in the raisins. Spread batter evenly into the crust.    
Bake in preheated oven until center is set, about 90 minutes. Cool in the pan. Chill cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
