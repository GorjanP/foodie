In a large bowl, combine the lemon and orange gelatin powders and add the boiling water.  Stir until the powders are dissolved, then stir the drained pineapple and marshmallows into the mixture and chill until firm.    
While the gelatin mixture is chilling, whisk together the pineapple juice, sugar, eggs and flour in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until thick.  Stir constantly and do not allow mixture to scorch.  Remove from heat and let before spreading over the congealed gelatin mixture.    
Toss the sliced bananas with the lemon juice to prevent browning of the fruit.  Drain the fruit and layer the sliced bananas over the custard mixture.    
Mix the whipped topping mix as directed on the packages and beat in the cream cheese until smooth.  Spread over the bananas and sprinkle with the toasted coconut.  Chill for several hours before serving.
