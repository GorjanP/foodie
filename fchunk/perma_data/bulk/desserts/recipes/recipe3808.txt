Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
In a medium bowl, mix flour, white sugar and 3/4 cup butter until crumbly.  Press into prepared pan.    
Bake in preheated oven 12 to 15 minutes, until light brown.    
In a food processor, combine eggs, brown sugar, vanilla and baking powder and process until smooth.  Pour in cherries and walnuts and pulse until just chopped and incorporated, but not pulverized.  Pour over crust.    
Bake 25 minutes, until center is set.    
To frost, cream together confectioners' sugar with 2 tablespoons butter and 4 tablespoons cherry juice until fluffy.  Frost cooled dessert and cut into bars.
