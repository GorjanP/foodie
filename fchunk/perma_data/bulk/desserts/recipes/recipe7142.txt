Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch cake pans; set aside.    
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Add water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla; beat with a spoon or wire whisk until batter is smooth. Divide evenly into prepared pans.    
Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove cakes from oven and place on wire racks to cool for 5 minutes.    
Remove from pans and cool completely. Place one layer on serving plate; spoon 1 cup non-dairy whipped topping onto cake layer; top with second layer and remaining whipped topping. Before serving, arrange sliced sweetened fruit, well drained, on top of torte. Serve.
