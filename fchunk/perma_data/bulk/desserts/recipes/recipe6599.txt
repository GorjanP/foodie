Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan. Sift together flour and baking powder.    
Beat the egg whites to soft peaks, then continue beating while slowly adding the sugar until stiff peaks have formed. Fold in egg yolks until evenly mixed, then fold in the flour mixture alternately with the orange juice. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake cake in preheated oven until the top has turned golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.    
When the cake is done, remove from the oven, and use a fork to poke all over the top of the cake, in 1 inch intervals. In a small bowl, stir together the milk, coconut milk, and sweetened condensed milk. Evenly pour the milk mixture over the cake, then sprinkle with coconut flakes. Chill cake in the refrigerator until cold, about 3 hours.
