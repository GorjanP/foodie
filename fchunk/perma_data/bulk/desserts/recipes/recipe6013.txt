Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate.    
Mix sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl; pour into pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.    
Five minutes before pie is done, beat egg whites and cream of tartar together in a bowl using an electric mixer on high speed until foamy. Slowly add sugar to egg white mixture and continue beating until meringue forms stiff peaks, about 5 minutes.    
Remove pie from oven and increase temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread meringue onto warm pie, making sure meringue goes all the way to the edges creating a seal. Using the back of a spoon, dab the meringue and pull up, creating peaks across the pie.    
Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature for 1 hour and store in the refrigerator.
