Place strawberries into a medium bowl. Dust with sugar, then pour the wine over them. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.    
Let the strawberries stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Spoon berries into 6 dessert cups, and distribute the remaining wine over the berries.
