In a large bowl, stir together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, pineapple, and 3 tablespoons of reserved pineapple juice. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream and marshmallows into the mixture. Add more pineapple juice, if needed, without making it too wet.    
Transfer the salad to an attractive serving bowl, smoothing top with a rubber spatula or large spoon. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Serve chilled.
