Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to a 4 quart saucepan, and heat over high heat. When oil is hot, add 1/2 cup of popping corn. Keep pan moving constantly.  When corn stops popping, remove from heat. Place popped corn in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all corn has been popped. Set aside.    
Melt margarine or butter in a medium saucepan, and then stir in brown sugar, syrup, and salt. Bring to a rolling boil, stirring constantly; boil without stirring for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.    
Stir baking soda, vanilla, peanuts, pecans, and almonds into brown sugar mixture.  Quickly pour nut mixture over warm popcorn, and toss until well coated.  Spread on greased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 45 minutes, stirring well every 15 minutes. Cool on aluminum foil, and store in an air-tight container.
