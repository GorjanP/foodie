Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place pretzels on baking sheets.  Unwrap candy kisses and place one in the center of each pretzel.    
Place in preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until kisses melt.  Remove from oven and place one candy-coated chocolate in the center of each pretzel.  Chill in refrigerator until set.
