Crush gingersnaps to a fine meal in a food processor.    
Mix cream cheese and ground ginger together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly add gingersnap crumbs to cream cheese mixture until it begins to pull away from sides of bowl.    
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.    
Roll cream cheese mixture into teaspoon-size balls. Dip each ball in the melted chocolate, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into bowl. Arrange truffles onto waxed paper to dry.
