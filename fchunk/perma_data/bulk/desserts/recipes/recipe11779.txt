Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.    
Mash bananas in a large bowl. Mix in oats, almond milk, almond butter, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and salt.    
Scoop spoonfuls of banana and oat mixture onto the baking sheet. Scatter sliced almonds over cookies; sprinkle turbinado sugar on top.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until set and browned on the bottom, 12 to 14 minutes.
