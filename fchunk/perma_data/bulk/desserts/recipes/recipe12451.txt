Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Add egg and vanilla extract and beat until well combined. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and mix into egg mixture until just combined. Fold in chopped hazelnuts.    
Use a tablespoon to cut off little portions of dough; roll them into balls. Place on the prepared baking sheet with room in between.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 20 minutes.
