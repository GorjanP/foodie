Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Pour coconut into a shallow bowl. Press each cookie dough slice into coconut to coat both sides. Arrange coated slices on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely.    
Drizzle caramel syrup over cooled cookies and top with hot fudge topping. Chill in the refrigerator until set, about 30 minutes.
