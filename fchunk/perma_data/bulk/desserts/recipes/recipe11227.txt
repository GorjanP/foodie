In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs, vanilla extract and butter. Using the fingers, mix well, until a firm dough has formed. Wrap in a clean tea towel and chill in the refrigerator 8 to 12 hours, or overnight.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Turn a 9 inch round baking dish upside down, and lightly grease the surface.    
Pinch off a portion of the dough and roll out into a 9 inch circle approximately 1/3 inch thick. Continue this process with all the dough, making 5 to 7 layers.    
Bake each layer individually in the preheated oven 8 minutes, or until lightly brown.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the dried fruit in enough water to cover. Cook until soft and spreadable, but not runny, about 20 minutes.    
Drain the fruit well. Mix in the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.    
Stack the layers, spreading equal portions of the fruit mixture between each layer and on top of the final layer. Chill in the refrigerator 8 to 12 hours, or overnight.
