Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, approximately 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl. Fold in bread cubes, blackberries, and cream cheese. Set aside until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.    
Place a layer of heavy duty aluminum foil or 2 layers of regular aluminum foil on a flat surface. Brush aluminum foil with melted butter.    
Arrange bread mixture in the center of the aluminum foil. Bring short ends together; fold over twice to seal. Bring sides in, leaving room for steam to form; fold over twice to seal.    
Grill over indirect heat until bread pudding is puffed, liquid is absorbed, and edges are toasty, about 35 minutes.    
Remove package from the grill; open carefully using tongs or mitts. Cool for 10 minutes.
