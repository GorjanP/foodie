Place cashews, 1 tablespoon peanut oil, and 1 teaspoon water in a food processor or blender; pulse until cashews are ground. Add 1 tablespoon water to cashew mixture and pulse until a thick and chunky paste starts to form. Add remaining 1 tablespoon water and 1 teaspoon peanut oil to mixture and pulse until desired consistency is reached. Measure 1/2 cup cashew butter and store remaining cashew butter in a container in the refrigerator for another use.    
Mix brown sugar, white sugar, cashew butter, coconut oil, butter, and egg in a large bowl. Combine quinoa flour, baking soda, xanthan gum, cardamom, and mace in a separate bowl; pour into sugar mixture and mix until dough easily forms into a ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for 1 1/2 hours.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Spread coconut flakes into a shallow bowl. Form cookie dough into small round balls using a spring-loaded scoop. Roll each cookie dough ball in the coconut and arrange on a baking sheet. Press each ball with a fork dipped in quinoa flour, making a criss-cross pattern.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the edges, about 8 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
