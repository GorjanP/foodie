In a large saucepan over high heat combine sugar and milk.  When bubbles form at the edges, stir in rice and reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook 60 minutes, stirring often, until rice is tender.  Do not allow to boil.    
Remove from heat and vigorously stir in beaten eggs, a little at a time, until well incorporated.  Serve warm.
