In a large bowl, beat yolks until very light and fluffy. Add sweetened condensed milk and beat until double in volume. Blend in lime juice. Place in refrigerator while whipping whites.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add white sugar and cream of tartar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.    
Gently fold whites into yolk mixture. Pour into crust and freeze. Serve frozen.
