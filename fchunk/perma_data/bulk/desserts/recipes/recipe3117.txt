Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9 x13 inch baking pan.    
Reserve 2/3 cup of the cake mix and set aside. In a large bowl combine the remaining cake mix, melted butter and 1 egg. Mix until crumbly then press mixture into the prepared pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, until light golden brown.    
Combine the reserved 2/3 cup cake mix, brown sugar, corn syrup, vanilla and 3 eggs. Beat at medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour filling over the baked crust and sprinkle with pecans.    
Return to oven and bake for an additional 30 to 35 minutes, until the filling is set. Cool and cut into 36 bars.
