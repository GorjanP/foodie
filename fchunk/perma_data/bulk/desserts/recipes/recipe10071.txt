Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Let egg whites stand until at room temperature.  Beat the whites until lightly foamy. Add the sugar gradually as you beat.  Beat until soft peaks are formed. Fold in the nuts.    
Transfer this all to a large saucepot. Cook over low heat, stirring all the time, until it thickens and turns a little brown, about 10 minutes.    
Spoon the cookies onto greased baking sheets by the teaspoonful, about 1 to 1-1/2 inches apart. Bake about 22 minutes, or until dry. Remove and place on a wire rack to cool.
