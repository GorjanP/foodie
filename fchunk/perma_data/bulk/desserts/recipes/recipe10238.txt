Beat 1/2 cup margarine, 1 1/2 cups potato flour, ice water, and salt together in a bowl with an electric mixer until mixture is large crumbs. Form into a ball of dough; chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.    
Stir blackberries, sugar, 1/3 cup potato flour, and lime juice together in a bowl.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Separate dough into two equal halves. Roll each half with a rolling pin to 12 inches in diameter. Press one crust in a 9-inch pie pan. Scoop blackberry filling into the prepared pan. Drizzle 3 tablespoons margarine over blackberry filling.    
Lightly press the other pie crust on top of the blackberry filling and seal the edges to the bottom layer's edges. Brush top crust with remaining 1 tablespoon melted margarine. Cut 2 or 3 slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.    
Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and blackberries are bubbling, about 40 minutes.
