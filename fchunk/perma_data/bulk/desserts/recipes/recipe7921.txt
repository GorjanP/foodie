Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Place bananas, flour, 1/2 cup sugar, butter, walnuts, egg, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Mix until well combined. Drop 3 tablespoonfuls of dough 2 to 3 inches apart onto baking sheet. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges are set, 15 to 20 minutes.
