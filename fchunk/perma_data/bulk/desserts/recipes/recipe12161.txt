Combine flour, yeast, and 2 teaspoons white sugar together in a bowl.    
Stir milk and water together in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until lukewarm, about 20 seconds. Pour milk mixture into the flour mixture and mix with a fork until dough is evenly combined.    
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 minutes. (Dough will be sticky.) Add salt to the dough and knead until dough is smooth, 2 minutes more. Shape dough into a ball, place on a floured surface, cover with a wet paper towel, and let rise for 10 minutes.    
Mix brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, walnuts, sesame seeds, and cinnamon together in a resealable plastic bag. Close bag and shake until filling is evenly combined.    
Roll dough into a cylinder, cut into 10 pieces and form each into a ball. Roll each ball into a 5-inch circle using a rolling pin. Place dough into the palm of your hand and spoon 2 tablespoons filling into the middle of the dough. Wrap dough around filling, forming into a ball by taking 4 corners of dough, pinching together in the middle. Take another 4 corners and pinch together, sealing completely. Place balls, seam-side down, onto a floured surface.    
Roll each ball into a 5-inch circle using a rolling pin, making sure filling stays in dough.    
Place margarine in a skillet, spreading around with a paper towel; heat over medium heat. Place dough in the melted margarine and cook until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes per side.
