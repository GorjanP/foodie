Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the bananas into a small glass baking dish.  Stir together the brown sugar, juice, and sherry; pour over the bananas, then sprinkle with nutmeg.  Melt the butter in a small pan over medium heat.  Stir in chopped nuts, and cook until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.  Pour over the banana mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes until the bananas are tender, and have become lightly glazed.
