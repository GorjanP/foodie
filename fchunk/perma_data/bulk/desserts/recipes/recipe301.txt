In medium saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until bubbles form at edges.  In a bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt.  Pour into hot milk, a little at a time, stirring to dissolve.  Continue to cook and stir until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Do not boil.  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and butter.  Pour into serving dishes.  Chill before serving.
