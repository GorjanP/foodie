Stir berry-flavored gelatin and boiling water together in a bowl until gelatin is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in cold water until evenly mixed. Pour gelatin mixture into small cups about 3/4-full. Refrigerate until set, 2 to 3 hours.    
Fill a plastic bag with whipped topping and cut 1 bottom corner of the bag; pipe whipped topping onto each gelatin cup. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs onto the whipped topping until fully covered, creating 'sand'. Arrange bear-shaped graham snacks on the 'sand'. Place an umbrella in the sand.
