Combine white sugar, brown sugar, and corn syrup in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl and heat until sugars have dissolved, about 1 minute. Stir in peanut butter. Place the cornflakes and peanuts into a large bowl and stir in syrup mixture, mixing well.    
Spray a 9x13 inch pan with cooking spray. Lightly press the corn flake mixture into the pan. Melt the butterscotch chips in the same microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30 second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or butterscotch will scorch. Spread over the cornflake mixture. Allow candy to cool, then cut into 1x2 inch bars.
