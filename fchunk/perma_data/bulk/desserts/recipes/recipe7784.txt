Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper; set aside. In a large bowl, or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the molasses. Gradually mix in the sifted ingredients. Divide the dough into thirds and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are crisp but not dark. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Decorate as desired.
