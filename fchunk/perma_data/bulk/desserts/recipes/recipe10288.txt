Whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix brown sugar, butter, and white sugar together in a separate bowl; add egg, egg yolk, milk, and vanilla extract; stir until well mixed.    
Slowly stir flour mixture into butter-sugar mixture until dough is thoroughly combined; fold in white chocolate chips and pecans. Refrigerate dough until chilled, at least 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Scoop dough by rounded tablespoons onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes; rotate baking sheet and continue baking until cookies are golden brown, about 8 minutes more. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Place caramels in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drizzle melted caramel over cooled cookies.
