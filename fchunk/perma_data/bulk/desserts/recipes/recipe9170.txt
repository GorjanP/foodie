Soften gelatin in cold water.    
Combine egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan.  Cook until mixture coats a spoon.  Stir in gelatin, and then mix in crushed raspberries.  Chill until partially set.    
Beat egg whites until stiff with 1/4 cup sugar and salt.  Fold whipped cream and egg whites into raspberry mixture.  Pour filling into chilled pie crust, and chill 3 to 4 hours.
