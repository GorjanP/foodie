Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Beat egg whites and sugar in large bowl until soft and creamy, about 2 minutes. Stir 2 cups shredded coconut and gluten-free flour slowly into the mixture until combined into a dough.    
Shape dough into walnut-size balls. Roll in the remaining shredded coconut and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
