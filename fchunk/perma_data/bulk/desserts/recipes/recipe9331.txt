Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix flour, sugar, pumpkin puree, oil, eggs, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla extract, cloves, nutmeg, and orange peel together in a bowl until dough is evenly mixed and sticky; fold in white chocolate chips. Drop dough, about 2 tablespoons per cookie, onto a baking sheet about 2 inches apart.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
