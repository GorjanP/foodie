Combine water, rice, and cinnamon in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, cover pot, and simmer until all the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.    
Mix milk, sugar, cocoa powder, cayenne pepper, and vanilla extract into rice mixture, increase heat to high; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.    
Remove pot from heat and pour pudding into a large glass bowl; let sit for 30 minutes before serving.
