Reserve one pinch of gelatin.  Combine most of gelatin with applesauce.  On a serving platter, place 4 graham cracker sheets, long edges together, in a single layer.  Spread 1/2 cup of applesauce mixture over crackers.  Repeat layers until all crackers and applesauce are used.  Frost with whipped topping.    
Sprinkle reserved gelatin over top of cake.  Chill in refrigerator 6 hours or overnight before serving.  Cut crosswise like a loaf of bread to serve.
