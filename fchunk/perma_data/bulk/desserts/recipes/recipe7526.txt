Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).    
Mix the mangos, drained crushed pineapple, white sugar, brown sugar, apple juice, and tapioca. Let stand in a bowl for 20 minutes.    
Pour filling into the unbaked pie shell, and dot with butter or margarine. Cover with top crust, and seal edges. Cut slits in top of outer crust.
