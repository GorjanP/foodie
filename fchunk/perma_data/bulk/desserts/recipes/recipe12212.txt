Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray and dust with flour.    
Mix milk and lemon juice together in a bowl.    
Beat egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form; beat in sucanat until fluffy. Mix olive oil into beaten egg whites mixture until smooth.    
Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, lemon zest, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.    
Stir egg white mixture, alternating with milk mixture, into the flour mixture until batter is smooth; pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
