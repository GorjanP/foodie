Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 8x3-inch loaf pans.    
Mix 4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, honey, eggs, oil, coffee, jam, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and baking soda together in a bowl until smooth; spread evenly into the prepared loaf pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove cake from pans and cool on a wire rack.    
Mix 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa powder, water, and 1 teaspoon flour together, stirring constantly, in a saucepan over low heat until mixture is smooth and thick, about 8 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and add margarine and brandy; whisk until glaze is thickened. Refrigerate glaze until cooled, at least 15 minutes.    
Spread glaze over cooled cakes.
