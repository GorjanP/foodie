Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and egg in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add flour, oats, malted milk powder, dates, apples, sultana raisins, coconut, baking soda, cinnamon, and ginger; mix until dough comes together.    
Scoop up 2 tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball between your palms. Place onto the prepared baking sheet; press down to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 10 minutes.
