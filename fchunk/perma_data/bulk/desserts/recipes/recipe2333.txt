Cook pudding as directed on package. After pudding thickens, turn down heat to low. Stir in cream cheese, condensed milk, and lemon juice. Stir frequently, as mixture may stick to saucepan.    
Pour mixture into graham cracker crust. Cover and refrigerate. When pie is ready, serve with whipped topping.
