Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.    
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in sour cream, almond extract, and vanilla extract until batter is smooth.    
Stir all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking soda, baking powder, cardamom, and salt together in a bowl. Add to the batter; mix on low speed just until combined.    
Spread batter evenly in the prepared pan. Scatter berries on top. Sprinkle sliced almonds and turbinado sugar over berries.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pan; serve warm or at room temperature.
