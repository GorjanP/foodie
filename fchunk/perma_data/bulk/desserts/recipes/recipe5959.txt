In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and molasses until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and allspice; blend into the creamed mixture.  Work dough with hands until well blended. Cover and chill for about 4 hours.  Dough must be thoroughly chilled to hold together.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll out dough paper thin a little at a time.  Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters.  Place on greased baking sheets.    
Bake 5 to 6 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
