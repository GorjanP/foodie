Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
On a lightly floured surface roll dough out to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 1 1/2 inch rounds. Transfer rounds to a tray or waxed paper sprinkled heavily with white sugar, turning to coat both sides with sugar. Place sugar coated rounds on an ungreased cookie sheet. Prick in four places with a fork, forming a "prick box".
