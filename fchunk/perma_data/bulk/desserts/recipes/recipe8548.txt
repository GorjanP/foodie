Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.    
Cut peaches in half and remove peach stones. Cut each half in half again.    
Wrap prosciutto around each peach section; secure with small bamboo skewers.    
Grill peaches, turning often, until prosciutto gets a little crisp around the edges and the peaches begin to caramelize, about 6 minutes.    
To serve, spoon burrata onto serving plates. Remove peaches from skewers; place several of the grilled peaches around the cheese. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with a sprinkle of sea salt and pepper; garnish with basil.
