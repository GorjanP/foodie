Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
In the top half a double boiler melt the chocolate and condensed milk, stirring frequently.    
Pour the melted chocolate mixture over the coconut. Stir in the vanilla and salt. Mix well until the coconut is completely coated. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet. Press one whole almond into the top of each cookie.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes. Check at 8 minutes as the bottoms tend to burn easily. Remove from oven and cool.
