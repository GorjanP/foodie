Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pastry shells on a baking sheet.    
Beat butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth and creamy; beat in brown sugar and honey. Beat egg, lemon juice, water, vanilla, and salt into butter mixture just until combined; stir in raisins. Fill tart shells 1/2-full with butter mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and pastry is golden, about 30 minutes.
