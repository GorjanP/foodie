Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Unroll 1 crust and press firmly against the side and bottom of an ungreased 9-inch pie plate. Prick bottom and sides with a fork.    
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool.    
Combine elderberries, 1 cup water, and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk 3 tablespoons water and cornstarch together in a bowl; pour into the saucepan. Cook and stir until filling thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in orange juice.    
Pour filling into the cooled pie crust. Lay second crust on top. Press edges together to seal with a fork. Cut slits in the top crust with a knife for steam to escape.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is bubbly, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour.
