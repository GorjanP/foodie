Combine the flour, 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and salt in a stand mixer using the paddle attachment. Mix until just combined.    
Add the butter and cream cheese to the bowl on low speed. Mix until the dough comes together.    
Turn dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap and form into a rectangle shape. Wrap the dough in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours up to overnight.    
Remove dough from the refrigerator when ready to bake, cut into two even pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a 12x4 inch rectangle between two pieces of parchment paper.    
Spoon 1/4 cup of the apple butter onto each rectangle of dough and spread evenly leaving a border of about 1/3 inch of bare dough around the perimeter.    
Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the apple butter on each piece of dough.    
Roll the dough, working with the long end and rolling towards you creating a 12 inch log. Place seam side down on parchment paper and chill in the freezer for 15 minutes.    
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves in a small bowl.    
Remove dough from the freezer, brush each log with milk then evenly sprinkle with the spice mixture.    
Slice into 1 inch pieces using a sharp knife and place seam side down on a parchment lined baking sheet.    
Bake for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.    
Transfer to a wire rack to cool, and store in an airtight container.
