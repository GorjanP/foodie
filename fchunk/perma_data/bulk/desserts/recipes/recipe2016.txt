Cream together the margarine, sugar and eggs.  Stir in vanilla, flour, baking soda and salt.    
Roll out (not too thin) and cut into any shape.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes.    
I have used confectioner sugar frosting, or buttercream frosting, or even canned frosting ( if I'm desperate).  Enjoy!
