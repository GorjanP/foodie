Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.  In a saucepan, melt 1 cup of butter.  Stir in 1 cup water and 4 tablespoons cocoa powder.  Remove from heat and set aside.    
In a medium bowl, dissolve the baking soda in 1/2 cup of buttermilk.  Stir in the eggs and vanilla.  Mix in the cooled cocoa mixture.    
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the cocoa buttermilk mixture.  Stir until blended.  Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  Ice the cake with Buttermilk Pecan Icing while it's still warm.
