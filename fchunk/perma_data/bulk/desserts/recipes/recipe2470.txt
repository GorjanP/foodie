Line two 9 inch round pans with parchment paper.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Measure sifted flour, baking powder, and salt; sift together three times.    
Cream butter or margarine and lemon rind together.  Gradually add sugar, creaming until light and fluffy.  Add egg yolks one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition.  Add sifted ingredients alternately with milk to the creamed mixture, a small amount at a time; beat after each addition until smooth.    
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool on wire racks.
