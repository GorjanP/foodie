Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)    
In a medium bowl, combine the rolled oats, flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.    
Sprinkle one half of crumb mixture in the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish. Cover with cherry pie filling. Sprinkle remaining crumb mixture over pie filling.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until topping is golden brown. Serve warm.
