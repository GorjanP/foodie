Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking pan.    
Melt butter in medium sauce pan. Remove from heat, and stir in sugar and cocoa. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the chocolate mixture until just blended. Fold in walnuts, if desired. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack.
