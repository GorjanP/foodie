Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Line a 10x15 inch cookie sheet with aluminum foil.    
Place crackers in a singe layer over prepared cookie sheet.  Use more or fewer crackers as needed to cover the bottom of your pan.    
In a small saucepan over low heat combine butter and brown sugar; bring to a boil.  Boil for 3 minutes; pour over crackers.    
Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes.  Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over the top.  Sprinkle almonds over chocolate chips; using the back of a wooden spoon, press nuts into chocolate.    
Chill in refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or until set.  Break into pieces and store, sealed, in refrigerator.
