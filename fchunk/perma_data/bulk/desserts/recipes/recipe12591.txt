Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)    
In the top of a double boiler, combine egg yolks, milk, 2 cups sugar and flour. Cook, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and coconut. Pour into 2 pie shells.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/3 cup white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pies, covering completely.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
