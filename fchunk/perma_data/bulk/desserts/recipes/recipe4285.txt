Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
In a medium sized bowl beat together the butter or margarine, sugar, eggs and vanilla. Stir in the flour, baking powder and cinnamon. Mix well then stir in the walnuts and raisins. Knead until dough comes together.    
Divide dough in  half and shape into long loaves, 1 1/2 inches thick. Place loaves onto the prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 18 to 20 minutes. Allow loaves to cool enough to handle (about 10 minutes).  With a sharp knife cut loaves diagonally into 3/4 inch thick slices. Place cut sides down on baking sheets. Bake slices for an additional 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
