Sift together flour, 1/3 cup cocoa, baking soda and salt, set aside.    
In a medium bowl, cream together shortening, 2/3 cup white sugar and brown sugar with electric mixer.  Beat in egg, and mix until light and fluffy.  Beat in water and vanilla until smooth.

Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until set.  Cool completely.
