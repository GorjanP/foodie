Beat 3/4 cup heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.    
Combine mango and sugar in a food processor; puree until smooth. Pour into a bowl; fold in melted white chocolate mixture and whipped cream.    
Place hot water in a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin on the water; allow it to melt 1 minute.
