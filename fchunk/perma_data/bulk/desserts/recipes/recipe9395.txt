Stir the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.    
Place the  strawberries into a blender, and puree until almost smooth. Mix the strawberries into the condensed milk mixture until thoroughly combined.    
With a large spoon, gently mix in the snow, about 1 cup at a time. Mix in the milk, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the snow ice cream is soft and holds its shape when spooned. Serve immediately; store leftover ice cream in an airtight container in the freezer.
