Cream together 1cup butter or margarine, shortening,  brown sugar, and 1 cup white sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla.    
Sift 2 1/2 cups of the flour and baking powder. Add alternately with milk to the creamed mixture.  Stir 1/2 cup flour with the chopped pecans, then fold into the batter.  Pour into prepared pan.    
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let stand in pan 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
