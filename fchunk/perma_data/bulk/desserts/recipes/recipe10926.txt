Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Whip egg whites until stiff. Gently fold in the sugar, pecan pieces, crushed butter crackers and vanilla extract and pour the mixture into a well greased 9 inch pie pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Cool. If desired, serve with vanilla ice cream or just whipped cream.
