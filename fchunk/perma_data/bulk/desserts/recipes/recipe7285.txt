Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 6 muffin cups or line with paper liners.    
Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder together in a bowl.    
Stir margarine, water, egg, and vanilla extract together. Beat margarine mixture into flour mixture. Fill each muffin cup halfway with batter; press candy kiss into the center of each half-filled muffin cup.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
