Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the peanut butter, shortening, and brown sugar. Stir in the egg, milk and almond extract. Sift together the all-purpose flour, rye flour, baking soda and salt, add to the creamed mixture and mix until just combined. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips and mini marshmallows.    
Drop cookies by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Allow cookies to cool for 1 minute on the baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
