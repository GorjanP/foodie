Combine all-purpose flour, cake flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix together on low speed.    
Stir milk and yeast together in a small bowl. Mix honey and tahini together in a separate bowl. Add milk mixture and honey mixture to the flour mixture. Mix together on medium speed to form a dough. Add water, butter, and orange zest; continue mixing until dough is firm and elastic.    
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.    
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Divide dough into 3 pieces and knead until smooth. Roll 1 piece into a rectangle that's about 6 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. Cut into 1/4-inch strips using a sharp knife. Arrange strips 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Repeat with remaining 2 pieces of dough.    
Bake in the preheated oven, watching carefully, until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
