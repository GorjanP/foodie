Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Beat white sugar, oil, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth.    
Whisk flour, coconut, lime zest, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into creamed mixture until dough is just combined. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden around the edges, about 8 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.    
Whisk confectioners' sugar and lime juice together in a bowl until smooth; spread over each cookie.
