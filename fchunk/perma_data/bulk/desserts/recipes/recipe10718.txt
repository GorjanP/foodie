Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking pan.    
Stir buttermilk and baking soda together in a bowl until dissolved and foaming.    
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat the first egg into butter mixture until completely blended; beat in the second egg until incorporated.    
Whisk flour and cocoa powder together in a bowl. Beat flour mixture, alternating with buttermilk mixture, into creamed butter mixture using an electric mixer until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool cake for 30 minutes.
