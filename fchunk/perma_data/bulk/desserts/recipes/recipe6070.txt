Cream 1 cup butter or margarine.  Gradually add brown sugar, creaming well.  Add egg yolk and blend.  Add flour, stirring until the mixture forms a dough.  Chill slightly for easier handling.    
Roll dough into small balls, about the size of a marble.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet and flatten to 1/8 inch thickness with the palm of the hand.  Press with fork in one direction to make a design.    
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 9 to 12 minutes until cookies just begin to brown very lightly.  Remove from sheet while warm.  Place flat sides of two cookies together with frosting, sandwich-style.    
To Make  Browned Butter Frosting: Brown 2 tablespoons butter slightly in saucepan.  Remove from heat and blend in 1 1/4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar.  Gradually add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 4 to 5 teaspoons cream until it becomes a spreading consistency.
