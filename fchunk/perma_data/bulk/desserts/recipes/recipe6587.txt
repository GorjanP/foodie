Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the butter into a 8x8-inch baking dish, and place into the oven until melted. Stir the sugar, nutmeg, and self-rising flour together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the milk until no lumps remain. Pour the batter over the melted butter in the baking dish. Do not stir. Spoon the sliced peaches over top; gently pour in the juice.    
Return to the oven, and bake until the batter has firmed and the cobbler has risen a bit, 35 to 45 minutes.
