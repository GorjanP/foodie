Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Make the streusel topping:  In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Cut in 1/4 cup peanut butter and 3 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups flour, 1 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, eggs, 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup butter. Mix well and pour into prepared pan. Spread evenly, then sprinkle streusel over top.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
