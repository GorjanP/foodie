Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).   Grease a 9 x 12 inch jelly roll pan .  You can also use a 9 x13 inch rectangular baking pan.    
Cream together the brown sugar and the butter or margarine.  Add the almond extract.    
Sift and add flour to the creamed sugar mixture.  Mix well.    
Separate the egg, and add the egg yolk to the dough.  Mix again.    
Press into the greased sponge roll tin, and glaze with the lightly-beaten egg white.  Sprinkle with flaked or slivered almonds.    
Bake approx 20 minutes.  When cool, cut into bars.
