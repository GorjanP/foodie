Grease a 9 x 13 pan, and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine cake mix, pudding mix, slightly beaten eggs, and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl.  Beat on medium speed until batter is light and fluffy.  Add 7-UP (TM) , and beat in well.   Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or till done.  While cake is baking, prepare the topping; it will take about 15 minutes to prepare.    
In a medium non-aluminum saucepan, combine sugar and flour.  Stir in 2 eggs, butter or margarine, and pineapple.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Remove from heat, and stir in coconut.  Spread topping over warm cake.
