Drizzle vanilla syrup over top of sponge cake. Let soak for 5 to 10 minutes.    
Arrange blueberries on top of cake, then place strawberries on top of the blueberries. Finish by generously spreading whipped topping over the fruit.    
Serve immediately, or if you prefer, chill in the refrigerator (no more than 2 to 3 hours), until ready to eat.
