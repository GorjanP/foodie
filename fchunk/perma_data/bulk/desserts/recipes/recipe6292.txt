Butter one 7x11 or 9x13 inch pan.    
In a 4 quart saucepan combine the sugar, marshmallow creme, evaporated milk and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Boil and stir for 5 minutes. (It will burn easily so watch it carefully.)    
Remove from the heat and stir in the peanut butter chips. Beat until chips are melted. Spread mixture into pan and let cool then cut into teensy squares.    
Variation: After mixture boils 5 minutes, divide mixture in half and add 1 cup peanut butter chips to one half and 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 1/4 melted butter to the other half.  Pour "blonde" mixture into pan.  Top with cocoa mixture.  Let cool before cutting into squares.
