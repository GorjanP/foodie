Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheet.    
Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cardamom in a large bowl.  Cut shortening in with a pastry blender or knives until the size of small peas.    
Stir in eggs, lightly beaten, and lemon extract.  Stir in milk on tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition.    
Mix everything together thoroughly.  Break dough off in small pieces and roll in the hands to rolls about 1-1/2 inches long.  Flatten slightly and roll in sesame seeds.    
Place on cookie sheet 3/4 inch apart.  Bake for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.
