In a 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat to 370 degrees or until a tortilla strip dropped in sizzles vigorously. Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside. Using tongs, slide one tortilla into the oil. Fry, turning once, until it stops sizzling and turns golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove and set on paper towels lining a large wire rack set over a shallow pan. Sprinkle liberally with cinnamon sugar. Repeat with one tortilla at a time, then the tortilla strips. (Can be stored in foil or a large tin overnight.)    
Up to 4 hours ahead, mix next 7 ingredients for salsa; refrigerate until ready to serve.    
Put 3 small scoops of sorbet or ice cream on each tortilla. Top with fruit, garnish with tortilla strips and serve immediately.
