Beat butter and cream cheese in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Add sugar; beat until mixture is pale yellow and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla extract, soft drink mix, and almond extract; beat well.    
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Add to cream cheese mixture; beat until well mixed. Add maraschino cherry juice, milk, or lemon juice to loosen dough; mix to incorporate. Divide in half; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Roll dough to 1/4-inch to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut out using a heart-shaped cookie cutter; transfer cookies to the prepared sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, about 15 minutes.
