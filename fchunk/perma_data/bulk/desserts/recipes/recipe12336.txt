Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.    
Mix cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl until batter is just mixed; press into the prepared pizza pans.    
Bake crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove crusts from oven and cool completely, at least 30 minutes.    
Whisk cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and almond extract together in a bowl until smooth; spread onto the cooled crusts.    
Arrange strawberries, pineapple, and peaches on the cream cheese layer.    
Combine white sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, water, and cornstarch together in saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until glaze is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and refrigerate glaze until cooled, about 20 minutes.    
Drizzle glaze over fruit and refrigerate pizza until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
