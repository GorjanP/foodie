Line a muffin pan with paper liners. In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Stir in the melted chocolate, then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Finally, stir in the vanilla and peppermint extracts and the nuts.    
Sprinkle a teaspoon of the crumbs into each muffin cup. Spoon the chocolate mixture evenly into the cups, then top with the remaining crumbs.    
Freeze for at least an hour. Keep frozen until serving time.
