Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 15 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, beat together egg yolks and egg white. Beat the egg mixture into the butter and sugar.    
In a separate bowl, sift together flour and baking powder. Stir flour into egg mixture alternately with milk. Stir in almond and vanilla extracts. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean.
