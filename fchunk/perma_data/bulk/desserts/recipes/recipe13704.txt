Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush enough coconut oil into a 9x5-inch loaf pan to completely coat the inside.    
Whisk eggs together in a large bowl; add coconut milk, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth. Mix coconut flour, blueberries, orange zest, sea salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder into egg mixture and whisk until batter is just mixed; pour into the prepared loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in pan before removing and cutting into cubes.
