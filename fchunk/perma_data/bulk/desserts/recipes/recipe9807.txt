Grease an 8 x 8 inch square pan.    
In a heavy saucepan over medium heat melt 1 cup of sugar, stirring constantly.  Carefully add boiling water.  Stir in remaining 2 cups of sugar, non-dairy creamer and salt.  Stirring constantly, bring mixture to a boil.  Without stirring, heat to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.    
Beat mixture until it loses gloss.  Immediately fold in grated orange peel and nuts and transfer to prepared pan.  Chill for 2 hours, or until firm, before cutting.
