Mix milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Stir in flour, sugar, and salt until well blended.    
Heat a crepe pan over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into the pan and tip the spread batter to the edges. Cook until bubbles form on the top and edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned and edges are golden, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.    
Let crepes cool. Cut lengthwise into strips 1 to 2 inches wide. Wrap strawberries, bananas, peaches, and kiwi in the crepe strips and thread wrapped fruits onto skewers.
