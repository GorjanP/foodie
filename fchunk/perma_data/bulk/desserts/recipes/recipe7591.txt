Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Beat butter, confectioners' sugar, and flour together in a bowl until smooth; add vanilla extract and almond extract. Knead dough until well combined, about 10 times. Shape or cut dough into small cookies; arrange on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, 20 minutes.
