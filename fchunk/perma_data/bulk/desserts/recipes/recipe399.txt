Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
In a large bowl, mix together flour, 2 cups sugar, cocoa, 1 teaspoon salt and baking soda.  Stir in oil, water, vinegar and vanilla until blended.  Pour mixture into prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.    
To make the filling:  In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese, egg, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt until light and fluffy.  Stir in chocolate chips.  Drop a heaping teaspoonful of the cream cheese mixture into each cupcake.  Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.  Allow to cool.
