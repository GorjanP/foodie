Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar.  Add eggs and beat until fluffy.    
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour,    baking powder, and salt. Dissolve the baking soda in the buttermilk and  add alternately to the margarine mixture with flour mixture.    
Roll out dough and sprinkle with nutmeg. Cut with a biscuit cutter.  Dough will be very soft and delicate.    
Bake until lightly browned around the edges.  A really soft, chewy  cookie.
