Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).    
Beat together egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar to soft peaks in a large bowl.  Beat in sugar, about three tablespoons at a time, until stiff and glossy peaks form.  Sift cocoa and cornstarch over egg whites, and gently fold in.  Gently fold in vinegar, vanilla, and melted chocolate.    
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spread the meringue into an eight inch circle.  Bake in the center of the oven for 1 1/2 hours until the outside is crispy and the center is soft.  Using a metal spatula, loosen the meringue from the parchment paper, and remove to cool on a wire rack.  Allow to cool completely, about one hour.    
Whip cream with the sugar, and spread over the meringue.  Arrange strawberries decoratively over the top, and drizzle with chocolate.
