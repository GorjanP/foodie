In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar and honey until light and fluffy. Stir in the sifted ingredients alternating with the milk and vanilla. Cover dough and refrigerate overnight.    
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide the chilled dough iinto quarters. On a well floured surface, roll the dough out  one quarter at a time iinto a 5x15 inch rectangle. Divide into rectangles using a knife. Place rectangles ointo ungreased cookie sheets. Mark a line down the center of each one, and prick with a fork. For a cinnamon flavored cracker, sprinkle with a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking.
