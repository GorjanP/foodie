In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars.  Add beaten eggs.  Mix and sift flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in another bowl.  Add flour mixture to the creamed mixture.  Stir nuts into the dough.    
Shape dough into 6 balls.  Roll out each ball on floured wax paper into a cylinder about the size of a silver dollar.    
Shake chocolate decorative candies or colored sugar onto wax paper.  Roll dough into the sugars or chocolate, enough to coat the sides of the dough.  Roll cylinders in wax paper, and place in the refrigerator overnight.    
Slice rolls into 1/4 inch slices, and place on greased cookie sheets.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes.
