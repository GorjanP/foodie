Place jasmine rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak, about 30 minutes. Drain.    
Bring jasmine rice and 5 1/2 cups water to a boil in a large pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until rice breaks down and grains disappear, about 20 minutes.    
Stir coconut milk and sugar into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Season with salt.
