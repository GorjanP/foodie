Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.    
Blend garbanzo beans, almond butter, maple syrup, almond extract, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a blender or food processor until batter is smooth; pour into a bowl. Fold chocolate chips into batter and pour into the baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to pull away from sides and center is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool brownies in the pan for 20 minutes before cutting into 16 squares using a plastic knife.
