Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 1 baking sheet.    
Combine 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons margarine and golden syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until margarine is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.    
Mix boiling water and baking soda in a small bowl until baking soda is dissolved. Stir into margarine mixture.    
Mix oats, all-purpose flour, sugar, coconut, and apricots together in a large bowl. Add water and margarine mixture; mix until dough is combined.    
Form dough into small balls and place on prepared baking sheet; flatten slightly.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
