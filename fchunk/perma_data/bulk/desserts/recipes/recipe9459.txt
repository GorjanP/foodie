Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with butter.    
Place a layer of blueberries into the prepared baking dish.    
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk together buttermilk, eggs, and sugar in a large bowl. Add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and stir until batter is smooth. Mix in vanilla extract and orange zest. Carefully pour over blueberries in the baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with a thin layer of brown sugar. Return to the oven and bake until sugar is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
