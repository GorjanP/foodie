Heat a small nonstick skillet on medium-high heat and add enough oil so a date can just float in it.    
Whisk milk, egg, and melted butter together in a large bowl. Combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a second bowl. Whisk flour mixture into milk mixture to make a pancake batter.    
Test if oil is hot enough by adding a drop of batter to the oil: batter should rise to the top and bubble around the sides, browning within 5 to 10 seconds.    
Dip 3 to 4 dates in the pancake batter until evenly covered and carefully place into the hot oil. Wait a few seconds for them to start browning, turning occasionally so they fry evenly. Fry until golden brown, but not burnt, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dates and batter.
