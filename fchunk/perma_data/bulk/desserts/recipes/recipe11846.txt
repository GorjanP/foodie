Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking pan.    
Combine apples and sugar in a bowl and toss to coat. Stir in oil, eggs, and vanilla extract.    
Stir flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and allspice in a separate bowl. Add to the apple mixture and mix well. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack.
