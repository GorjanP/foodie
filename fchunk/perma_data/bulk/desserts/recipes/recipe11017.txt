Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Fold in cornstarch.  Transfer to the top of a double boiler and set over low heat.    
Stir in sugar and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, until edges of mixture begin to pull away from pan.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.  Stir in coconut.    
Drop dough by spoonfuls 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and firm to the touch.  Cool on the pans on wire racks.
