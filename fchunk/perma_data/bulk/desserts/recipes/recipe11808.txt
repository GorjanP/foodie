Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat margarine and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour, cornstarch, and salt; mix by hand until dough comes together in a ball.    
Place dough on a flat work surface and roll out to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
