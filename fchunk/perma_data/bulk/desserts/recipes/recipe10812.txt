Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat sugar, butter, and shortening together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add water, egg, and vanilla extract and mix well. Add flour, flaxseed meal, cocoa powder, yeast, salt, and baking soda. Mix well. Fold oats, chocolate chips, and walnuts into the dough.    
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
