Prepare Champagne Cake I as directed, but bake in two 9 inch round pans. Allow to cool. When cool, put together with coconut filling.    
Coconut Filling: Over boiling water in double boiler, melt 16 marshmallows, butter and wine. Remove from heat and add coconut.    
Fondant Frosting: Sift powdered sugar  in top of double boiler. Add corn syrup and water. Stir over boiling  water until smooth. Add the vanilla, salt and almond flavoring. For  pink champagne effect, add 2 or 3 drops red food coloring.    
Keep frosting warm so it spreads evenly. With spoon, carefully pour fondant over top and sides of cake. Slice marshmallows into 4 rounds each, dip in fondant and place at random on top of cake.
