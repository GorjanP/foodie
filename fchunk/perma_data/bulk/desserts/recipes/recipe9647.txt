In large bowl, mix all ingredients at medium speed until well mixed.  Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Use part of dough at a time, keeping the rest refrigerated.    
Using a cookie press fitted with a bar-plate tip, press dough in long strips, about one inch apart down the length of the cookie sheets.    
With a sharp knife, cut each strip into 2 1/2 inch pieces.  Leave pieces in place.  Bake 8 minutes or until light golden.  Do not to overbake.    
Remove from oven and immediately cut again between cookies to separate any cookies which are still joined together.    
Move cookies to wire rack, and allow cookies to cool completely.  Store tightly covered.
