In a large mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar at medium speed until fluffy. Beat in egg yolk and apple butter. Add flour, cinnamon, apple pie spice, and vanilla. Beat at low speed until well blended.    
Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a 6-inch disc on waxed paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Invert one disc of dough into ungreased 9-inch round pie plate. Press dough into plate with lightly floured hands,  covering plate completely. Flute edges using the handle of a wooden spoon. Deeply score into 8 wedges. Prick surface using tines of fork. Repeat steps with remaining disc of dough and another pie plate.    
Bake 35 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack. Cool completely and cut into wedges.
