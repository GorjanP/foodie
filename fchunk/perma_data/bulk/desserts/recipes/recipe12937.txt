Coat the bottom of the graham cracker crust with 2 tablespoons caramel; cover with 1/2 of the chopped pecans.    
Mix pumpkin puree, milk, vanilla pudding mix, cheesecake pudding mix, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl until smooth. Pour over pecans in the pie crust. Smooth whipped topping over the surface with a spatula.    
Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons caramel over whipped topping. Garnish with remaining chopped pecans. Refrigerate until pie is chilled through and firm, at least 1 hour.
