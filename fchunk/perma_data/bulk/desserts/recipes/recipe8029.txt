Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9 x 13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, mix dates, 1 teaspoon soda, and boiling water.  Cool.    
Add flour, 1 cup sugar, mayonnaise, and remaining 1 teaspoon soda.  Use medium speed of mixer, and beat until mixture is well blended.  Stir in nuts.  Spread batter in prepared pan.    
Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.    
While the cake is baking, prepare the lemon sauce.  Mix beaten egg and 1/4 cup water; place in a medium saucepan.  Add 1 cup sugar, butter or margarine, and lemon peel and juice.  Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Serve sauce over warm cake.  Refrigerate any leftover sauce.
