Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Combine flour, brown sugar, chopped walnuts, and melted butter and mix well. Spread evenly in a shallow baking pan.    
Bake for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from oven; when cool enough to handle, sprinkle 2/3 of the crumb mixture into a 13x9-inch baking dish.    
Mix sliced strawberries with sugar; set aside.    
Combine egg whites and lemon juice in a large bowl. With electric mixer, beat until stiff (pasteurized whites take longer to beat than fresh egg whites, so be patient). Mix in sugared strawberries.    
Fold in whipped cream. Spoon fruit and cream mixture over crumb crust. Sprinkle remaining crumbs on top.    
Freeze 6 hours or overnight. Cut into squares and garnish with whole strawberries, if desired.
