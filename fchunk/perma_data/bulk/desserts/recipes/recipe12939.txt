Pour sesame seeds into a coffee grinder; grind into a fine, sticky powder, about 45 seconds.    
Pour sesame powder into a large bowl. Mix in pistachio nuts, honey dates, carob powder, and vanilla extract. Mix by hand until a stiff dough forms. Add water if dough is not forming properly. Press into a pan; slice into squares.
