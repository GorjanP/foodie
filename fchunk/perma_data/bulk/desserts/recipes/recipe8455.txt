Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.    
Rinse the rice under cold water. Drain, and cook rice in the milk over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all the milk. Remove from heat and set aside.    
In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks on high speed until they are pale yellow and doubled in volume.  Add the egg yolks to the butter mixture, blending well, and then add this to the rice.  Add the orange zest and the raisins.    
In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peak stage.  Gently fold the whites into the rice mixture.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 50 minutes or until the top of the cake is golden brown and puffed up. Cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes before turning out.  Cool completely.  Serve chilled.
