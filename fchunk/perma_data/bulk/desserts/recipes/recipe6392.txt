Place chocolate into a bowl; add chipotle pepper and salt.    
Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until it comes to a boil. Pour cream over chocolate and let stand for 3 minutes.    
Stir gently until chocolate mixture is completely smooth. Pour chocolate mixture out onto a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Pick up one edge of the plastic and roll the chocolate into a rough log shape. Continue to roll, wrapping chocolate in the plastic. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.    
Place cocoa into a small bowl. Unwrap chocolate and cut in half crosswise; cut each half into halves lengthwise. Roughly cut candy into 1/2-inch square 'stones'. Place the chocolate pieces into the cocoa and toss gently to coat.
