Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets or line  with parchment paper.    
Cream butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla until very smooth and fluffy.    
In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.  In a food processor, blend oatmeal until fine.  Add to flour mixture.    
Stir butter mixture into flour/oatmeal mixture. Blend well.    
Add chocolate chips and walnuts.  Stir until blended.  Roll into golf balls size and bake for 8-10 minutes.  You do not want to over bake these.
