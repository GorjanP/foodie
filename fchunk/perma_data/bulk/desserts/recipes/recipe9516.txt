Melt remaining butter in a non-stick stock pot over medium heat; add marshmallows and cook, stirring frequently, until the marshmallows are melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pot from heat.    
Stir crispy rice cereal, brown sugar and butter-flavored breakfast cereal, and fruit flavored breakfast cereal into the marshmallow mixture to coat; pour into the prepared baking dish and press flat.
