Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Blend in the sifted ingredients until just incorporated. Mix in the cereal, coconut, walnuts and raisins. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart.    
Bake for 9 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
