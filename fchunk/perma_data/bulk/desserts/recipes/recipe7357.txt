Combine flour, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, baking powder, vanilla sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Work in butter with your fingers until mixture resembles small crumbs. Add milk and egg and knead into a soft dough. Place in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Roll dough into long, thin 8-inch ropes, pinching one end into a pointy tip. Arrange in the shape of a little poop-mound with the pointy tip on top and place onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between individual cookies.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly darkened on the bottom and dried, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully remove from baking sheet and transfer onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 2 hours.    
Mix 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar with lemon juice to form a thin icing. Glue 2 candy eyeballs on each poop cookie and let dry.
