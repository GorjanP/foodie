Prepare brownies according to package directions.  Bake and cool completely.  Cut into 1 inch cubes.    
In a medium bowl, whisk together milk and pudding mix until mixture begins to thicken.  Dissolve coffee granules in water and stir into pudding mixture.  Fold in whipped topping.    
In a glass serving bowl, layer one-third of brownie cubes, one-third of pudding mixture and one-third of candy.  Repeat layering until all ingredients are used.  Chill 30 minutes in refrigerator before serving.
