Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.    
In a large bowl, cream the butter, and sugar.  Mix well.    
In a separate bowl, beat eggs and add to the butter mixture.  Stir in the caraway seeds and flour.  Mix well.    
Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut into 1 inch squares (or other shapes) and place at least 1 inch apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes...watch closely...until lightly colored.  Cool on wire racks.
