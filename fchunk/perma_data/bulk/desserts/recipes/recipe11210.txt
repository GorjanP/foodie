Grate the rind from two of the oranges into a saucepan and set aside.  Cut away the skin and white pith from all of the oranges.  Cut into thin slices, discarding any seeds, and reserving any juice. Pour the orange juice into the saucepan along with the honey, and gelatin; stir over medium heat until the gelatin dissolves.    
Make a thin layer of orange slices on the bottom of an 8x4 inch loaf pan, and sprinkle with some of the 3 tablespoons of chopped mint; alternate layers of orange slices and mint until used up.  Slowly pour the hot orange juice over the oranges.  Tap the pan lightly to remove any air pockets.  Chill overnight until firm, unmold, and cut into thick slices; garnish with 1 tablespoon of mint.
