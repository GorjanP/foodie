Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.    
Heat the orange juice, sugar, and about half the cranberries in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil; simmer until the cranberries pop, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in the apples and the rest of the cranberries. Remove from heat, allow to cool for several minutes, then pour into the prepared baking dish.    
In a bowl, mix together the pecans, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and oats. Stir in the butter until thoroughly incorporated, then sprinkle the oat topping over the fruit mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling and the oat topping has begun to brown, about 45 minutes.
