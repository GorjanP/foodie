Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.    
Place 1 vanilla wafer cookie in the bottom of each muffin cup. Place the remaining cookies in a container and crush to crumbs.    
Place caramels in a medium saucepan; add milk. Heat on low, stirring occasionally until melted, about 10 minutes.    
Beat cream cheese, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until cheesecake filling is smooth. Distribute 2 tablespoons of the filling into each muffin cup.    
Stir two-thirds of the melted caramel mixture into the remaining cheesecake filling; mix well. Distribute 2 tablespoons of caramel-cheesecake mixture into the muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set, about 1 hour. Let cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes.    
Reheat the remaining caramel sauce until warm, about 2 minutes. Drizzle onto the cheesecakes. Sprinkle the cookie crumbs on top. Remove cheesecakes from the muffins tins; place on a serving platter. Cover and refrigerate until cool, about 4 hours.
