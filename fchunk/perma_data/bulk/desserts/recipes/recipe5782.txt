Butter a 12x15 inch sheet of aluminum foil and dust generously with confectioners' sugar.    
In a saucepan over medium-high heat, mix together the sugar and evaporated milk. Stir frequently and bring to softball stage of 235 degrees F. Stir in dates and nuts; allow mixture to cool.    
Form the candy into a roll about 1-1/2 inches in diameter and wrap in the prepared foil; refrigerate until firm. Slice thinly with a knife dipped in hot water to serve.
