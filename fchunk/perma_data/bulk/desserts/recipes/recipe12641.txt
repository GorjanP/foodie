Sift the flour, 5 tablespoons sugar, and salt into a large bowl, and make a well in the center. Whisk together the eggs, butter, olive oil, wine, rum, and lemon zest in a separate bowl until smooth; pour into the flour mixture. Stir together until a dough forms, then knead on a lightly floured work surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 1 hour.    
While the dough rests, stir together 5 cups white sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and cornstarch in a large saucepan. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Stir in the vanilla. Add the unsweetened chocolate, and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, then remove from the heat and allow the sauce to cool to room temperature.    
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Roll with a well-floured rolling pin to a thickness of 1/8 of an inch. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 2x5 inch rectangles. Alternately, pinch off an egg-sized piece of dough and roll it through a pasta machine. Repeat with the remaining dough.    
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Fry the Chiacchiere a few at a time until golden brown; remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. To serve, pour the cooled Sanguinaccio sauce into a bowl, and sprinkle with chocolate chips to garnish. Place the fried Chiacciere onto a serving platter and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar to serve.
