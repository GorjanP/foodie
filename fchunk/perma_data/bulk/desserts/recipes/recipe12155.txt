Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 48 miniature muffin cups.    
Combine strawberry cake mix and citrus-flavored soda in a bowl until batter is smooth; spoon into prepared muffin cups. Place 1 chocolate chip on top of each cupcake.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
