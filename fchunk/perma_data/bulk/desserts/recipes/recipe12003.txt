Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread on the underside of each chocolate chip cookie. Cover with chocolate sprinkles.    
Place marshmallow on a stick and heat over an open campfire flame until it begins to brown and melt, 1 to 2 minutes.    
Sandwich the marshmallow between the cookies. Let marshmallow cool briefly before eating, 1 to 2 minutes.
