Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9 inch round cake pan with vegetable oil spray, and line the bottom with parchment paper.    
In a medium bowl, whip the eggs and sugar together until light. Stir in the vanilla and raspberry sauce. Toss the flour together with the walnuts, fold into the egg mixture. Pour into the prepared pan. Tap the pan firmly on the counter to remove air bubbles.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool cake in pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. In a small saucepan, stir together the apricot preserves and brandy over medium heat until soft and liquidy. Strain and pour over cooled cake. Whip cream together with confectioners' sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Serve cake with a big dollop of whipped cream on the side.
