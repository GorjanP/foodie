Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter 6 custard cups or ramekins.    
Mix eggs, egg yolks, and flour together in a bowl until smooth. Whisk pumpkin puree, half-and-half, milk, sugar, salt, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger into egg mixture until smooth; spoon into prepared custard cups.    
Arrange custard cups onto a large baking pan. Pour enough water around the custard cups to fill pan halfway.    
Bake in the preheated oven until custards are set in the middle, about 40 minutes. Serve at room temperature or chilled.
