Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl. Add eggs and beat until light and fluffy. Combine the nutmeg, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a small bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and add this mixture to the creamed ingredients. Gradually stir in the flour one cup at a time. If dough is still too sticky to roll, gradually add more flour until you can form the dough into a ball. Cover and chill dough for at least an hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut into shapes and place on ungreased cookie sheet.    
Bake until no indentation remains when cookies are lightly touched, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on rack.
