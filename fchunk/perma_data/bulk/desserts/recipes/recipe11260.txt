Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Set aside.    
Pour hot water over raisins. Stir in instant coffee and cinnamon. Set aside to cool.    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour mixture. Finally stir in the raisin mixture.    
Spread batter on prepared 10x15 inch pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
