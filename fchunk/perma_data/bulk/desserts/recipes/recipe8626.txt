Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until almonds are fragrant and toasted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool; grind in a food processor until almonds are a flour-like texture.    
Mix ground almonds, crushed vanilla wafers, confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir 1 cup melted chocolate chips, pumpkin, and coffee liqueur into vanilla wafer mixture. Shape mixture into 1-inch balls and arrange on a baking sheet. Refrigerate or freeze truffles until solid, 1 to 2 hours.    
Melt 1/2 cup chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Dip truffles in melted chocolate and return to baking sheet to harden.
