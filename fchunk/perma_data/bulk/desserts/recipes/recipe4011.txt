Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan.  Add 2 cups light brown sugar and beat well to mix.  Cool the mixture slightly, then beat in eggs and vanilla.    
Sift together all-purpose flour, salt and baking powder.  Stir it into the wet ingredients, then add the nuts.  Mix well.    
 Spread batter in a greased 11 x 7 x 2-inch pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a light gold.  Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out of pan and let brownies finish cooling on a rack.    
To Make Frosting: Disolve coffee in the water. Cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioner's sugar.  Beat it until light.  Beat into the sugar mixture.  Spread over the brownies.  When frosting has set, cut brownies into squares.  Enjoy!
