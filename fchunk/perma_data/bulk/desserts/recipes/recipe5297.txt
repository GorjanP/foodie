In a medium bowl, mix rice flour, tapioca, sugar, salt and coconut.  Stir in water, a little at a time, and mix to form a thick batter.    
Peel the bananas and cut each lengthwise into 3 or 4 pieces.  Heat oil in deep-fryer or deep wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Completely coat each banana slice in batter, then fry in hot oil until golden.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve at once.
