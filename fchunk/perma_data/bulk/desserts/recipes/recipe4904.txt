Butter a small cake pan.    
To prepare Nougat:  In a frying pan place 1/2 cup of sugar over medium heat and stir.  Sugar will turn into liquid caramel.  When syrup becomes dark brown, pour into cake pan and let harden.    
Crush nougat in a mortar or between waxed paper with a hammer into small pieces.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Separate the egg and add the yolk and water.  Blend thoroughly. Stir in 1/2 cup of sifted flour and the nougat.  Mix well.  Sift in the rest of the flour.    
Knead the dough lightly on a board. Roll the dough into a 1-inch in diameter log.  Slice into 1/2-inch thick cookies. Place on greased cookie sheets 3 inches apart and press down with a fork.    
Bake 10 to 12 minutes.
