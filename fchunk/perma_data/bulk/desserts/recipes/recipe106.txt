Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.    
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, coconut and salt. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla using your hands until well blended. Use an ice cream scoop to drop dough onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about golf ball size.    
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until coconut is toasted.
