Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9-inch pie plate.    
In a large mixing bowl cream together butter or margarine, brown sugar, and honey. Add egg and blend until mixture is smooth.    
In a separate bowl combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix thoroughly, then add to sugar mixture. Stir until well combined. Divide dough in half.    
With floured fingers press one half of dough into bottom of greased pie plate. Place pie plate in freezer and place other half of dough in refrigerator.    
After 20 minutes, remove pie plate from freezer. Spread chocolate hazelnut spread over frozen dough.    
Roll out remaining dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Fit dough on top of chocolate hazelnut layer and press firmly on edges to seal.    
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes until lightly browned. Cool 5 minutes, then cut into 8 slices. Allow tart to cool completely in pie plate before serving.
