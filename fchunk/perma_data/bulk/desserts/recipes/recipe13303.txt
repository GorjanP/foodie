Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mix brown sugar, butter, and egg in a bowl until well blended.    
Mix hemp seeds, flour, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Stir into the brown sugar mixture until dough comes together.    
Drop spoonfuls of dough onto the baking sheet; flatten with the back of the spoon.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are crisp, 8 to 11 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, 10 to 15 minutes.
