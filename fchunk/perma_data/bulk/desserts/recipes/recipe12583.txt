Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch round pan.    
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda and cocoa. Make a well in the center and pour in the water, oil, vinegar, vanilla and almond extract. Mix well and pour into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
