Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine almond flour, coconut flour, cacao powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.    
Combine 1/2 cup agave nectar and eggs in a bowl. Stir into the flour mixture; batter will be wet. Scoop, 2 tablespoons at a time, onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are set, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 20 minutes.    
Beat cream, 2 tablespoons agave nectar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form.    
Slice biscuits in half widthwise. Place bottom halves on a platter; top each with a dollop of whipped cream and some strawberries. Cover with remaining biscuit halves and more whipped cream and strawberries.
