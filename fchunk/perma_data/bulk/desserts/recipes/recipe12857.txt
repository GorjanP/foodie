Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper, extending paper up sides of pan; set aside.    
Prepare brownie mix according to package directions. Pour half of batter into pan. Cover with half of caramel topping, chocolate chunks and almonds. Pour in the remaining brownie batter.    
Drop remaining caramel by rounded teaspoons onto brownie batter. Swirl with a knife. Top with remaining chocolate chunks and almonds.    
Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until edges are set. Remove and let tray cool completely in pan. Use edges of parchment to lift brownies from pan onto a cutting board. Pull back edges of parchment for easy cutting. Cut into bars.
