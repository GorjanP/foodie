Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg whites one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the rolled oats. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
