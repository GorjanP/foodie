Combine pumpkin puree, egg, coconut oil, honey, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Add almond flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cardamom; stir until well combined. Pour into a large microwave-safe mug.    
Microwave on high until set, about 2 minutes, watching closely so it does not overflow.
