Heat 6 oz chocolate in heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until melted. Remove from heat.  Stir in 2 tablespoons margarine, the half and half  and 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  Shape mixture into 1 inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Freeze uncovered about 30 minutes, until set.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix 1/2 cup margarine, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, the vanilla and 1 oz chocolate.  Work in flour and salt until dough holds together.  (If dough is dry, mix in 1 or 2 tablespoons milk).  Mold portions of dough around frozen chocolate balls to form 1 1/2 inch balls.  Place about 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until set but not browned.  Remove from cookie sheet.  Cool completely on wire rack.
