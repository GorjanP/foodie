Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with 10 paper cupcake liners. For guaranteed crumble-free cupcakes, grease the liners.    
Beat together the oil, sugar, salt, vanilla, and eggs. Add the milk, and whisk until smooth.    
In a separate bowl, sift together the coconut flour and baking powder. Add this mixture to the wet ingredients, and stir to combine.    
Evenly divide the batter among the 10 liners, filling each 3/4 full.    
Bake the cupcakes on the center rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.    
Remove the cupcakes from the oven, and let them cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Turn them out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely.    
Frost the cupcakes with your favorite frosting.
