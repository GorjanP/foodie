Combine the sugars, flour, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl.  Add the eggs and yolk one at a time, and mix well.  Stir in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla.  Pour filling into the shell.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes.  When the side of the pan is tapped, the center should still wobble like gelatin.  Cool on a rack.
