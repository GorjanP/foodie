Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Mix together the flour and sugar in a medium bowl. Stir in the eggs until well blended, then fold in the apples. Pour into a greased 9 inch pie plate.    
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
