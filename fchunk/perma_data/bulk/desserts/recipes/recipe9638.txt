Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.    
Sift the flour into a bowl and cut in the butter or margarine.  Mix in the sugar and almonds. Using a fork, mix in the egg until dough becomes stiff.    
Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.  Roll out dough into a thin layer and cut into rounds, 2 inches wide.  Re-roll trimmings and cut until you have 20 rounds. Place rounds on cookie sheets.    
Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light brown.  Let cool on the   sheet for about 3 minutes, then transfer to wire racks.    
When biscuits are completely cold, spread half  of the rounds with a thin layer of preserves and  sandwich together.  Dust with confectioners' sugar.
