Spread butter onto the cut-sides of each doughnut half. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over the butter. Sandwich a pineapple ring between the halves of each doughnut.    
Prepare four squares of aluminum foil with cooking spray. Put each sandwich onto the prepared side of a foil sheet; wrap foil around sandwiches to seal into a pouch.    
Cook by placing pouches near a campfire until heated through, about 20 minutes.
