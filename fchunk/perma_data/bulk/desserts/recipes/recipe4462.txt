Preheat oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolk and vanilla extract. Sift together the flour,  cornstarch, and salt; stir into the butter mixture. Shape dough into 20 to 24 small balls, about 1/2 inch in diameter.  Roll each ball in the oats and place about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown.  Let cool on wire rack. Store in an airtight tin.
