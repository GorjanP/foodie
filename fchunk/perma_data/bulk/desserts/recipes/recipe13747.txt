Butter an 8-inch square pan.    
Butter the sides of a heavy, 2-quart saucepan; add sugar, sour cream, corn syrup, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook until mixture comes to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture reaches 239 degrees F (115 degrees C) or until a small amount of sugar mixture dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove saucepan from heat.    
Stir butter and vanilla extract into sugar mixture and cool to lukewarm, about 110 degrees F (43 degrees C). Beat mixture vigorously until fudge is creamy and no longer glossy. Fold cherries and walnuts into fudge; pour into the prepared 8-inch pan. Allow to cool until hardened, at least 1 hour.
