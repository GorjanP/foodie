Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cake mix, margarine, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well combined; fold in white chocolate chips. Form dough into balls using a cookie scoop and arrange on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet 1 minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool.
