Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, combine crushed cookies, dates, pecans, almonds, white sugar and brown sugar. In a separate glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold egg whites and coconut extract into cookie mixture until no streaks remain.    
Pour filling into partially thawed pie crust. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool completely before slicing.
