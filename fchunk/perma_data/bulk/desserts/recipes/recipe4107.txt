Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites to stiff peaks. Stir in white sugar. Fold in coconut and cornflakes. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until coconut is golden.
