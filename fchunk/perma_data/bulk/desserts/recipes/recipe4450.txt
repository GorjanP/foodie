To make filling: in a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, and cream of tartar until smooth. Add egg; beat on low just until combined. Pour over crust.    
To make topping: in another medium-sized bowl, combine brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and cinnamon. Add apples and stir until coated. Spoon over the filling. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup slivered almonds.
