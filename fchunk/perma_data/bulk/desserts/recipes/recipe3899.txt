Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease a 9 inch square baking pan.    
To prepare Filling:   In a heavy pot, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and chocolate chips.  Add the evaporated milk and 1/4 cup of the white sugar.  Bring to a rolling boil, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.  Stir in nuts and cool.    
To prepare cookie base:  Cream 1 1/2 cups of the butter and the brown sugar together.  Add the vanilla and the egg, and beat until light and fluffy.    
Add the flour, baking soda, and 1 3/4 cups of the oats and blend well.    
Press 2/3 of this mixture into the bottom of the greased pan.   Spread the cooled filling on top of the cookie crust.    
Mix the remaining 1/4 cup of oats with the remainder of the cookie base, and crumble over the filling.  Bake for 25-30 minutes.
