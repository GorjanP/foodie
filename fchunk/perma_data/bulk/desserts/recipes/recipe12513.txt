In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until softened.  Beat in honey.  Add egg yolk, orange peel and orange juice and mix well.    
In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, nutmeg and salt.  Add flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until  well mixed.  Cover and chill at least 3 hours.    
Preheat oven to 325 degree F.    
Separate egg and slightly beat egg white.  Shape dough into 1-inch balls.    Roll in egg white and then in the nuts.  Place 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.    
Cut each cherry into 6-8 wedges.  Place 4 or 5 wedges  atop each ball so that it looks like a flower; press lightly.  Bake for 15-18 minutes.  Remove and cool on rack.
