In a small bowl, combine the eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract and raisins. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the raisin mixture until well blended. Stir in oats. Roll into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
