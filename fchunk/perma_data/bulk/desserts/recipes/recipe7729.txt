Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.    
Pulse chocolate sandwich cookies in a food processor until they are fine crumbs. Set aside 1/2 cup crumbs in a small bowl. Add cream cheese to remaining crumbs in the food processor; pulse until well combined.    
Shape cream cheese mixture into walnut-size balls using dampened hands.    
Melt chocolate and shortening in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, about 1 to 3 minutes.    
Dip balls in the chocolate mixture, turning with a fork to completely coat. Lift the truffles out of the chocolate mixture using 2 forks, letting excess chocolate drip into the bowl. Transfer truffles to the prepared baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle reserved cookie crumbs over truffles.    
Chill truffles in refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.
