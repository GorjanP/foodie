Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch baking dishes.    
Mix cake mix, raspberry preserves, sour cream, milk, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until batter is well mixed; pour into the prepared baking dishes.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cakes completely, at least 1 hour.    
Spread lemon frosting over each cooled cake.
