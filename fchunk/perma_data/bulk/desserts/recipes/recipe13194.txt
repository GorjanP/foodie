Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix pumpkin, heavy cream, and eggs together in a large bowl. Add 1 cup white sugar, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg; mix well.    
Pour 1/2 cup melted butter into a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Mix 1 cup flour, milk, 3/4 cup white sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl until just combined. Pour over melted butter in the pan. Spoon pumpkin filling evenly on top. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter; sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.
