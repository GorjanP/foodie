Knead on floured surface till smooth, and shape into a ball.  Place dough into a greased  bowl  and cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled, then divide in half.    
To make Filling:  Combine the poppy seeds with the lemon peel and lemon juice and mix well.  Set aside.    
Roll each half of the risen dough into a 17 x 12 inch rectangle.  Cut into 4 inch circles.  Put about 1/2 Tablespoon of the filling on each circle.  Moisten the edges, bring the sides together and pinch, forming a triangle.  Place on a greased cookie sheet and cover.  Let the dough rise again until doubled.    
Brush with egg yolk mixed with water, then bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for  15 to 20 minutes.
