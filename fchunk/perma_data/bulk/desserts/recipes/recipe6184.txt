Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Melt the butter in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in the sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Spread the mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly firm, about 10 minutes.    
Stir the coconut and condensed milk together in a bowl; spread over the baked crust and return to oven for 12 minutes more. Set aside to cool at least 10 minutes.    
Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Stir the almonds into the melted chocolate; spread evenly over the cooled coconut layer. Allow to cool until the chocolate sets.
