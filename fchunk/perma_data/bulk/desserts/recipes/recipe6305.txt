Roll half the pastry out to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate and chill for at least 20 minutes before baking. Roll out top crust and set aside.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Mix together the huckleberries, tapioca, sugar, salt, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar.    
Pour mixture into unbaked pie shell. Dot top with butter. Add top pastry and flute edges. Cut vents for steam and place pie on a baking sheet.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden and the juices are bubbling, 45 to 55 minutes more. You'll need to bake the pie longer if the berries were frozen. Cool pie on wire rack.
