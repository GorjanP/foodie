Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Whisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.    
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs and beat until creamy and smooth. Add oats, chocolate chips, and blueberry jam; beat until evenly distributed. Mix flour mixture into blueberry jam mixture until just combined. Drop spoonfuls of dough, 2-inches apart, on prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
