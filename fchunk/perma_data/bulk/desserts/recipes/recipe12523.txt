Place eggs in bowl and beat until they have tripled in volume.  Add flour gradually until well blended (do not use all the flour).  The dough should remain slightly sticky.    
Transfer to floured board.  Cut off a piece at a time.  Using a little flour, if needed, roll between your hands to form pencil shapes.    
Cut into 1/4 inch pieces.  Place each on floured cloth. In a large pan on top of the stove, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Deep-fry pieces about 1/2 cup at a time, turning constantly until golden.  Drain and set aside.  (Note:  after several batches, dough begins to turn brown quickly.  This means it is time to change the oil)    
In large pan, bring honey to boil with vanilla bean.  Discard bean.  Place deep-fried pieces into hot honey and toss until all are coated.  Cool and stir in chocolate, nuts, and multi-colored jimmies.  Place on plate, shaping firmly into tall cone.  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.
