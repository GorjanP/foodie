Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Set aside.    
Cream together the sugar and butter until light. Continue beating and add 7 eggs, one at a time; beating well after each egg    
In a separate bowl, mix together flour and cornstarch.  Beat half of the flour mixture into the egg and sugar mixture.    
Beat in 1/2 cup whipping cream, and then beat in the remainder of the flour mixture. Finish by beating in 1/2 cup more of whipping cream and vanilla.    
Pour into prepared pan and bake for about 60 to 75 minutes. Cool on rack for 10 minutes before turning it out onto a serving plate.
