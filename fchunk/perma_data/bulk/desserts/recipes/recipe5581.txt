Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in the egg yolks. Gradually mix in the flour to form a dough. With lightly floured hands, press half of the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread evenly with raspberry jam. Flatten pieces of the remaining dough and place them over the raspberry layer to cover the top.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly golden. Cool slightly before cutting into bars.
