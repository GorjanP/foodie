In a medium bowl, cream the shortening and sugar together until fluffy. Stir in the egg, poppy seeds, yogurt and orange zest. Sift the flour and baking powder together; mix into the creamed mixture.  Divide dough into 3 portions, wrap in plastic, and chill overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut dough logs into 1/4-inch slices. Place circles onto an unprepared cookie sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.
