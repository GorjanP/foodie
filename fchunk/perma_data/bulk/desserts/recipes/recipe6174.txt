Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan. Combine flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt in a bowl.    
Place the tofu into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Add the olive oil and sugar. Blend for 1 more minute; pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the vanilla extract.    
Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Mix the melted chocolate into the tofu mixture until well blended. Stir in flour mixture until thoroughly combined, about 3 minutes. Fold in the chocolate chips.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool before slicing into bars.
