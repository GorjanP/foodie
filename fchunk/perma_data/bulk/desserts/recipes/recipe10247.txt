Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Add 1 egg, allowing it to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next with the vanilla extract.    
Dissolve cream of tartar in milk; beat into the butter mixture. Add 4 cups flour and pinch of salt; beat until doughy.    
Spread 1 cup flour onto a flat work surface. Roll the dough out on the prepared surface; cut out in desired shapes until all dough is used.    
Bake on non-stick baking sheets in preheated oven until cookies are set in the middle, about 12 minutes.
