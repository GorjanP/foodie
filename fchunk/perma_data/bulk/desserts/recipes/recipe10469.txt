Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans.    
Combine cake mix, eggs, water, vegetable oil, and pudding mix in a large bowl; beat until combined and smooth. Divide batter between loaf pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
