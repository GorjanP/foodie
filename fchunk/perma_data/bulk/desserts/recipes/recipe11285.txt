In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, butter or margarine, and sour cream into a soft dough.  Chill one hour.    
To Make Filling:  Combine the raisins, coconut, chopped nuts, and sesame seeds.    
Roll out one third of the dough to a thin sheet. Spread with one third of the jam. Sprinkle one third of the filling on the jam. Roll into a log jellyroll-fashion. Repeat two more times. Cut rolls into 1 - 2 inch cookies and place on greased cookie sheets.    
Place cookies on a greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes.    
Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar while still warm.
