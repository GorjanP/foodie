In a medium bowl, mix together flour, 2/3 cup brown sugar, and salt. Cut in butter or margarine until mixture resembles rice. Reserve 3 tablespoons of mixture for sprinkling top of pie.    
In a separate bowl, mix together hot water, molasses, dark brown sugar, and baking soda. Stir molasses mixture into remaining crumb mixture. Pour into pastry shell. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
