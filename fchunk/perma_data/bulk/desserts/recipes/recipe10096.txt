Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Process flour, oats, baking soda, and salt in a food processor until blended.    
Beat peanut butter, brown sugar, white sugar, shortening, and unsalted butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well-blended. Add vanilla.    
Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture; add crushed peanut butter candy and stir until just combined. Drop 1-inch spoonfuls of the dough, 2 inches apart, onto baking sheets.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes.
