Whisk yolks with 1/4 cup sugar and salt in a bowl until smooth; gently whisk in cream and vanilla extract. Strain custard mixture into a liquid measuring cup.    
Line bottom of a 6-quart oval slow cooker with a folded kitchen towel to create a level surface so ramekins won't slide around. Set four 4-ounce ramekins on the towel. Fill slow cooker with enough water to come halfway up sides of ramekins.    
Pour custard evenly into ramekins. Drape paper towels over top of slow cooker liner to absorb any condensation during baking; cover with lid to secure.    
Cook on Low until custard is set but jiggles slightly, about 2 hours.    
Transfer ramekins to a rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Refrigerate custards, uncovered, until cold, at least 3 hours.    
Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over each ramekin and shake gently to distribute evenly. Heat the sugar using a culinary torch until melted and browned, about 1 minute.
