Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Place each pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish, and line pastry with a double layer of aluminum foil and a layer of pie weights or dried beans.  Bake in the preheated oven until edges of crusts are golden, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights and bake until the crusts have set, about 5 minutes more. Remove from oven; set aside to cool.    
Bring 3/4 cup water, lime juice, sugar, and the reserved liquid from the mandarin oranges to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl; stir into the saucepan. Continue simmering until syrup has thickened. Remove from heat; set aside.    
Whisk the milk, half-and-half, and vanilla extract into the vanilla pudding mix in a large bowl. Allow the pudding to thicken for 5 minutes before spreading evenly into the baked pie crusts. Arrange the strawberries, kiwis, apricots, and mandarin orange segments decoratively on the pudding. Drizzle the prepared glaze thoroughly over each pie. Chill in refrigerator before serving.
