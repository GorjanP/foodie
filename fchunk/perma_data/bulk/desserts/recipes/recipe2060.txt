Preheat oven to 400 degrees F ( 205 degrees C).    
Submerge peaches in boiling water for about 1 minute.  The amount of time required to make the skin easy to peel varies with the degree of ripeness: if really ripe, it may take less time.  Remove peaches with a slotted spoon, and run cold water on them.  Slip off the skin.  Cut peaches into wedges, and place in either a deep 10 inch pie plate or a 2 inch deep 2 quart baking dish.  Toss peaches with lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar.  Cover with foil.    
Bake 15 minutes, or until the peaches are hot and bubbly    
Whisk together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and baking soda.  Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles small peas.  Pour buttermilk over top, and toss with a fork until the mixture clumps together.  Drop heaping tablespoons of dough over the peaches.  In a small cup, mix 2 teaspoons sugar and nutmeg.  Sprinkle over biscuits.    
Bake until biscuits are golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Set dish on wire rack to cool 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
