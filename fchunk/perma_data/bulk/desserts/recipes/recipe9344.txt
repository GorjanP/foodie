Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat eggs, applesauce, peanut butter, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth.    
Combine oats, all-purpose flour, flax seed meal, whole wheat flour, baking soda, and cinnamon in another bowl. Stir egg mixture into oat mixture and add apples; mix until evenly blended.    
Roll dough into golf ball-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden, about 12 minutes.
