In a large bowl, blend together butter or margarine, white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, sour cream, eggs, and vanilla.  Add to these ingredients the flour, baking powder, and soda.  Blend until smooth.    
To Make Filling:  Combine cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar.    
Grease and flour a large Bundt pan.  Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan.  Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mix on top of the batter in the pan, and cover with the remaining batter.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool.    
Make a thick glaze by mixing together confectioners' sugar with 2 to 3 tablespoons milk until smooth.  Pour over cooled cake, and add sprinkles if desired.
