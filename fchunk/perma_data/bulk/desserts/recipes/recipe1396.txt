Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie pan with margarine.    
Fill 2/3 of the pan with sliced apples. Sprinkle with cinnamon and 1 teaspoon sugar.    
In a medium bowl, mix 1 cup sugar with the melted margarine. Stir in pecans, flour, egg and salt. Mix well. Spread mixture over the apples.    
Bake in preheated oven for 65 minutes, or until golden brown.
