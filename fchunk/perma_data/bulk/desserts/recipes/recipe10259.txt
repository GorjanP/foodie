Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil; cook the chocolate fettuccine until tender but not mushy, about 2 1/2 minutes. Drain the pasta and immediately place into a large bowl filled with ice water. Allow to stand until chilled, about 5 minutes.    
Drain the pasta again and toss with canola oil in a bowl to lightly coat. Refrigerate until fully chilled, at least 15 minutes.    
Lightly whisk the whipped cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and cocoa powder together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined.    
To make the desserts, divide the chocolate fettuccine between 4 dessert plates.    
Spoon a dollop of chocolate whipped cream on the fettuccine on each plate.    
Place 1/2 cup of vanilla ice cream onto the whipped cream.    
Spoon 2 tablespoons chocolate topping onto each dessert to serve.
