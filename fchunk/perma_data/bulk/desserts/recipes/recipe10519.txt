Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Slice cookie dough and arrange in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan to make crust.    
Bake cookie crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 14 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 30 minutes.    
Spread ice cream over cookie crust. Sprinkle half of the toffee bits over the ice cream. Cover with a layer of chocolate shell topping. Sprinkle remaining toffee bits over the topping before it sets.
