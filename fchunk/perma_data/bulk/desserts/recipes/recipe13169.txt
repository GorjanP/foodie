Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch cake pans.    
Beat sugar and 3/4 cup plus 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Add flour; mix until incorporated.    
Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add to the flour mixture and mix well. Add milk and baking powder; stir. Mix in lemon juice.    
Pour batter into the prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
