Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening, light brown sugar and dark brown sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the milk and vanilla, blending until the mixture is light and fluffy. Combine the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter until well blended. Mix in cinnamon chips and if using, pecans. Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, just until the cookies lose their gloss. Remove from the cookie sheets to wire racks to cool.
