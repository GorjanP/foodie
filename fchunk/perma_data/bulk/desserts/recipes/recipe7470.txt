Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease an 8 inch square pan.    
Whisk together 3/4 cup white sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add in melted chocolate, butter or margarine, vanilla, and milk; mix to combine.  Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with the two sugars, 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white, and the cocoa.  Pour cold coffee over the top, but do not stir in.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Serve warm.
