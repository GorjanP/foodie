Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly flour a baking sheet.    
Roll puff pastry into a thin sheet on a floured surface. Cut into squares about the length of your hand and place on the prepared baking sheet.    
Beat egg and water together in a bowl;  brush each pastry square with egg wash. Stab each square a few times with a fork.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool at least 10 minutes.    
Mix guava paste and jam together in a bowl until smooth.    
Cut a large, vertical slit into each pastry. Spread 1 tablespoon guava mixture into each slit, making sure guava doesn't squeeze out when closed.
