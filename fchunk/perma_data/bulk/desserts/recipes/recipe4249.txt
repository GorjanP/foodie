Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.  Set aside.    
Combine the apples and the white sugar; set aside.  In a large bowl, mix together the brown sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla.  Stir in the apple mixture, then the flour mixture. Fold in the walnuts.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
