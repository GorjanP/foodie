Combine 1/2 cup sugar, flour, milk, and chopped chocolate in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to bubble. Reduce heat; simmer and continue stirring for 2 minutes more.    
Remove pan from heat. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup sugar into egg yolks.    
Pour the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Return filling mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat for an additional 90 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and stir in butter and vanilla.    
Pour filling into pie shell, and chill until set, about 4 hours. Top with whipped cream and a little grated chocolate before serving.
