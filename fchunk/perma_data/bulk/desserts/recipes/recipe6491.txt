In a bowl, mix the cream cheese and strawberry preserves. Fold in the whipped topping. Scoop the mixture into the prepared pie crust, and set aside.    
In a blender or food processor, blend the strawberries, sugar, and grenadine syrup until slightly chunky. Spread over the cream cheese mixture. Chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before serving.
