Preheat over to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Spray 11 x 15 inch jelly roll pan with non-stick spray.   
Completely cover with a single layer of graham crackers. Sprinkle with almonds.    
Combine butter, vanilla, and brown sugar in a heavy saucepan. Place over medium heat and bring to a full boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute.         
Carefully pour evenly over crackers (this mixture is hot!).   Bake for 8 minutes. Let cool for 3 to 4 minutes.          
Evenly space chocolate bars over cracker/toffee mixture. Wait 1 minute and spread chocolate to cover.  When completely cool, cut into 2 inch squares or break into pieces.
