Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the unbaked pie crust into a 9 inch pie plate.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and 1/3 cup of sugar. Add the rhubarb, and toss to coat. Pour into the pie shell.    
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. While it bakes, mix together the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of sugar and the eggs until smooth and well blended. Pour over the rhubarb when the 15 minutes is up, and return to the oven.    
Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the pie again for 30 minutes. While it is baking this time, stir together the sour cream, 2 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread over the top of the pie as soon as it comes out of the oven. Allow to cool, then cut into wedges and serve.
