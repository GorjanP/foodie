Pour the gelatin mix into a medium bowl, and stir in the boiling water. Set aside to cool slightly.    
In a blender or large food processor, combine the cream cheese, salad dressing, cucumber, pickle, and onion. Process until fairly smooth. Stir into the gelatin mixture. Pour into a mold, or leave in the bowl. Refrigerate for 3 hours, or until firm.
