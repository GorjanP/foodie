Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour two 9 inch round pans.    
In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugars.  Beat in the eggs.    
In another bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt.  Add this alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture.  Stir in the vanilla.  Chop the chocolate chips coarsely, and add to the batter.    
Pour batter into prepared pans, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until knife inserted in middle comes out clean.  You can fill with a Butterscotch Filling, and top with a Chocolate Glaze.
