Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (225 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, beat the eggs until foamy. Mix in sugar, lemon juice and chopped pineapple. Pour into pie shell and dot the top with butter. Cover with top crust, crimp edges to seal, and cut a few slits for steam vents.    
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake 35 minutes more, until golden brown.
