Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.    
Combine sugar, milk, margarine, and cocoa powder in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring often, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in oats, peanut butter, and vanilla extract. Drop about 1 tablespoon of mixture per cookie onto the prepared baking sheet. Let stand until cookies are cooled and firm, about 30 minutes.
