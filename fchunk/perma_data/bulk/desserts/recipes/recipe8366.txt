Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. Over a double boiler, melt the semi sweet chocolate, the unsweetened chocolate, and the butter; stirring occasionally.    
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for 6 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the melted chocolate mixture, and mix for 1 more minute. Fold the sifted ingredients into the chocolate mixture with a rubber spatula. Cover the dough and chill for half an hour to an hour.    
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C ).  Grease cookie sheets.    
Drop cookies by heaping tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven.  Let cookies cool completely before removing from cookie sheets.
