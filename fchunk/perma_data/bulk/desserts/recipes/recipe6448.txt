Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix all of the whole wheat flour together with the cinnamon, baking powder and salt.    
In a separate bowl, mash the butter, demerara sugar, and brown sugar together until thoroughly combined, then stir in the apple butter until smooth. Stir in eggs, vanilla extract, and apple juice until well mixed; pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture about 1/3 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Mix in the oats and chopped apple.    
With 2 teaspoons, form the dough into balls and place onto ungreased baking sheets about 2 inches apart.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are lightly browned and set in the centers, about 10 minutes; allow to cool for about 2 minutes on baking sheets until removing to finish cooling on wire racks.
