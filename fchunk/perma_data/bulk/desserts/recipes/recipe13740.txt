Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Blend prunes and water together in a blender until smooth. Beat prune puree, butter, and honey together in a bowl until smooth; beat in eggs and vanilla extract.    
Slowly beat cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into prune mixture; add flour and mix until dough comes together. Divide dough into 24 portions; form 1 dough portion into a ball around 1 caramel. Repeat with remaining dough and caramels. Place finished balls 2-inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle coconut over dough balls.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 10 minutes.
