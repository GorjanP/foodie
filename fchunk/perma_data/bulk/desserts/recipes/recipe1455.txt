Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream butter, cream cheese, and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks one at a time. Beat in the butter flavoring. Beat in the flour mixture.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Fold the egg whites into the batter. Pour into greased and floured Bundt pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
