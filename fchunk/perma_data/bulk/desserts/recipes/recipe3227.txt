Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the cake mix into a mixing bowl, and work in the butter until the cake mix resembles corn meal. Spread the berries into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish, and sprinkle evenly with the crumb topping.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the berries are tender, and the crumb topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
