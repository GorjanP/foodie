Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 8 muffin cups with cupcake liners.    
Place 1 wafer in the bottom of each cupcake liner.    
Mix cream cheese with 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add egg, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Mix until batter is smooth.    
Fill each wafer-lined muffin cup 1/2- to 2/3-full of batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 15 minutes. Top each with blueberry pie filling.
