Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place frozen mini tart shells on a baking sheet.    
Beat the butter, sugar, egg, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract, mixing until fully combined. Stir in the coconut. Place 1/2 teaspoon of jam into each mini tart shell, and fill the shells with about 1 tablespoon of the coconut mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the shells and topping are lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
