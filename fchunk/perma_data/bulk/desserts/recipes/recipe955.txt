Blend the above ingredients together with a pastry blender until mixed.    
Roll  in balls about the size of a quarter and place on ungreased baking sheets.  Make an even number of balls.    
Bake for 10 minutes.  Let cookies stand on cookie sheet for 5-6 minutes before removing them to cooling rack.  After cookies have cooled, put Cream Cheese Frosting (see recipe or use one can of pre-made frosting) between two cookies, putting bottom sides together.    
NOTE:  Adding chopped pecans to the cookies without making them into sandwiches is also very good.  Spice cake mix can be used in place of Devil's food.
