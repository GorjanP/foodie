Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Mix peaches, blackberries, 1/2 cup gluten-free flour, white sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon together in a bowl; spread evenly into the prepared baking dish.    
Stir brown sugar, oats, and 3/4 gluten-free flour together in a separate bowl. Cut butter into oat mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle evenly over berry mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
