Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, beat together butter or margarine, sugar, and eggs with an electric  mixer on low speed.   Blend in flour.  Mix in 1/2 cup of milk at a time.  Add 1 cup coconut and vanilla, and mix well.    
Pour filling into unbaked pie shell.  Sprinkle top with additional coconut before baking, just enough to lightly cover the top.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until set.
