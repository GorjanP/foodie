Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Butter a large baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Blend in vinegar and vanilla. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. With a large spoon, drop meringue in 8 mounds (about 4 inches diameter), close together on baking sheet. Indent the center of each meringue with the back of a spoon.    
Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven, and let shells cool in the oven, about 1 hour.    
To serve: Fill each shell with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and smother with thawed strawberries.
