Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Chop cookies coarsely.    
Combine 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons peanut butter, sweetened condensed milk, and peanut butter chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high until melted, stirring halfway through, about 3 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract and chopped cookies.    
Pour mixture into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Cut into squares.
