Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Line 48 mini muffin cups with mini paper liners.    
Beat cake mix, water, vegetable oil, eggs, and unsweetened drink mix powder until batter is smooth and evenly colored.    
Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about 2/3 full of batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cupcakes are set in the middle, about 15 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean.    
Allow mini cupcakes to cool before decorating.
