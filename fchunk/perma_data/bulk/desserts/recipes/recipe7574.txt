Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan.    
In a saucepan over low heat, mix the peaches, brown sugar, cornstarch, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. Cook and stir until sugar is melted and mixture is slightly thickened.    
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and lemon zest. Stir in eggs, vanilla, 1/2 cup oil, and orange juice. Mix until smooth. Pour 1/2 the batter into the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 the peach mixture, then with remaining batter. Top with remaining peach mixture.    
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
