Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Mix bananas and baking soda together in a bowl. Add cake mix; stir to create a thick batter. Spread into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
