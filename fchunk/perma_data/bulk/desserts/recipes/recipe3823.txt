Combine the sour cream, sugar, yogurt, vanilla extract, and orange liqueur in a large bowl.    
Pour the whipping cream into a saucepan, and heat over medium-high heat just below the boiling point. Slowly stir the heated cream into the sour cream mixture. To serve, pour the cream mixture into 1/2 cup Irish coffee glasses to 1 inch below the rim. Top each glass with sliced strawberries.
