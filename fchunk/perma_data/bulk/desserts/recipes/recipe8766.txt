In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and lard until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla and buttermilk. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; blend into the creamed mixture. Cover dough and chill for at least 2 hours.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut with cookie cutters, into desired shapes. Place on unprepared cookie sheets.    
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
