Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking pan.    
Beat egg whites in a bowl until soft peaks form.    
Stir bread mix (not including cinnamon sugar packet), water, vegetable oil, and egg yolk together in a bowl until batter is just mixed; fold in egg whites.    
Beat pumpkin puree, cream cheese, white sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl.    
Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan; swirl in the pumpkin mixture. Pour remaining batter over pumpkin layer; top with cinnamon sugar packet from bread mix.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.
