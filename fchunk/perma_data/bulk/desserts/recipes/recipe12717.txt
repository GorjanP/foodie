In a saucepan, stir together the sugar, tapioca, goat's milk, and egg. Set aside for 5 minutes for the tapioca to soak.    
Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.    
Remove from heat and stir in the rose water.    
Ladle the pudding into 4 small individual dessert dishes. Cover each dish with a piece of plastic wrap, pushing the wrap down onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Let the puddings cool slightly on the countertop, about 5 minutes.    
Chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
