Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray.    
Combine spice cake mix, 1 cup water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Add sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup cookie butter, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice. Increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes.    
Arrange slices from 1 pear on the bottom of the prepared pan. Pour batter on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.    
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in remaining pear slices, 1/3 cup water, 1/4 cup honey, and cinnamon whiskey. Cook until pears are soft and the water has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.    
Combine cream cheese, heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, 3/4 cup cookie butter, 1/2 cup butter, 2 teaspoons honey, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until frosting is slightly stiff, 10 to 20 minutes.    
Remove sides of the springform pan to release cake. Slice into three even layers; transfer middle and top layer to a flat work surface. Invert bottom layer and peel off base so pear slices are facing upward. Cover with middle cake layer; arrange pear and honey mixture evenly on top. Add top cake layer.    
Spread frosting over the top and sides of the cake.
