Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.    
Combine sugar, flour, eggs, shortening, whole milk, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and baking powder in a large bowl; pour into the prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
