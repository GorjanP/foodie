Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 (12 cup) muffin tins with paper liners.    
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese and sugar. Mix until soft. Add eggs and combine. Add vanilla.    
Distribute evenly into 2 (12 cup) lined muffin tins and bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 35 minutes.    
When done, the centers will fall in a bit while cooling. When cool, fill depressions with 2 to 3 tablespoons of your favorite fruit pie filling. Store in the refrigerator.
