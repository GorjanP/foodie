Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.    
Beat shortening and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Blend egg into the shortening mixture. Add hot coffee and stir.    
Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into the shortening mixture. Fold raisins and chopped nuts into the batter; spread into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
