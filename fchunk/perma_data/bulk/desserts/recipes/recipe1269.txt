Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, stir together the rhubarb, strawberries and honey. Transfer to a shallow baking dish. In the same bowl, stir together the oats, brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix in the butter until crumbly, and spread over the top of the fruit.    
Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until rhubarb is tender and the topping is toasted. Serve warm.
