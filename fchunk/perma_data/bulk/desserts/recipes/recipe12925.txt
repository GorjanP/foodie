Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.    
Beat butter and sugar in a second large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in the egg. Gradually blend in the flour mixture until dough is just mixed.    
Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a log 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap logs in waxed paper and chill for 4 hours.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Cut the logs into ¼ inch thick slices and place 1 inch apart onto baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly colored, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
