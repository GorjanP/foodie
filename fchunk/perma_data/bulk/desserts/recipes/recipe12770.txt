Scoop out kiwis and puree in a food processor or blender; you should have about 2 cups. Transfer to a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until reduced to about 1 cup, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.    
Stir cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl. Whisk in half-and-half slowly; add cooked kiwis and vanilla extract. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Pour mixture into the bowl of an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Cover and chill in the freezer until firm, at least 2 hours.
