Mix shortening, white sugar, egg, molasses, and water thoroughly.  Sift together flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, baking soda, and spices  and blend in.  Chill dough until firm.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees  F (205 degrees C).    
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet.  Bake about 8 minutes, or until almost no imprint remains when touched lightly.  While slightly warm, frost with icing.    
To Make Frosting:    Blend confectioners' sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Add cream to make icing easy to spread.  Spread on cookies with spatula or pastry brush.
