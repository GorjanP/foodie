Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Beat butter and honey together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs and mix well. Mix rice flour, baking powder, and cardamom into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Roll dough into small balls, about 1 heaping teaspoon each.    
Pour hemp seeds into a bowl and press each dough ball into the seeds, coating half of each ball. Transfer dough balls to the baking sheet, gently pressing to 1/4-inch thickness.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 20 minutes.
