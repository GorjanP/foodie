With an electric mixer, combine peanut butter, butter, vanilla extract, syrup, and eggs.    
In another bowl, mix sugars, flour, oats, salt, and baking powder.  When the dry ingredients are mixed, fold dry mixture into the earlier (wet) mixture.    
Add crushed peanuts and peanut butter chips to the dough.    
Roll dough into balls, pressing slightly with a fork.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12-15 minutes, until cookies are slightly browned.
