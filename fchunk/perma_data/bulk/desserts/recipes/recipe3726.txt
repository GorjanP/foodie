Combine milk with vinegar to make sour milk.  Let stand for 5 minutes.    
In a large mixing bowl, combine sugars, shortening, eggs, and vanilla.  Add flour, soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.    
Stir in sour milk and mix well.  NOTE:   Dough will be very sticky and hard to handle.  You could refrigerate it for a few hours, or just use plenty of flour when rolling out.    
Roll on well floured board to 1/2 inch thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters to desired shapes (large cutters work best).    
Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly brown on bottom.    
Frost with Sugar Cookie Frosting (see recipe) and decorate.
