Mix together cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and flour in a bowl.    
Add sausage, coffee, sugars, and eggs to the dry ingredients. Add raisins and nuts. Pour into an ungreased angel food cake pan.    
Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour or till a toothpick comes out clean.    
Garnishes may be added such as drizzled white frosting with whole cherries and mint leaves. This cake is so moist. If you like the flavor of rum you can wrap a rum-soaked damp cloth around it and refrigerate for several weeks. Best served with a spoonful of whipped cream.
