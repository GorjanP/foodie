Place about 1 teaspoon chocolate chips into an ice cream cone, followed by a layer of mini marshmallows. Continue layering chips and marshmallows into the cone until full. Repeat with remaining chips, marshmallows, and cones.    
Wrap each cone tightly in aluminum foil.    
Heat the foil-wrapped cones in a campfire until chocolate and marshmallows are melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
