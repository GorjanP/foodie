Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish and place in preheating oven until butter melts.    
Whisk flour, sugar, milk, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish and top batter with peaches.    
Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cobbler comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
