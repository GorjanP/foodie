Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square pan.    
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the egg, and mix in the molasses.    
In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Blend into the creamed mixture. Stir in the hot water. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in pan before serving.
