Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Place graham crackers in a resealable plastic bag and crush into fine crumbs with a rolling pin. Pour into a bowl. Add butter and brown sugar; toss together until mixture resembles wet sand. Place 1 tablespoon in the bottom of each paper liner. Press firmly to form the crusts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.    
Meanwhile, beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until well blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in eggs, one at a time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in sour cream and vanilla extract. Divide the mixture evenly over the 18 crusts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tops look dry and centers jiggle slightly, about 15 minutes. Chill until firm, 2 hours to overnight.    
Heat cream in the microwave until it begins to simmer, about 1 minute. Add chocolate chips and let sit until softened, about 1 minute. Whisk until chocolate melts and ganache is glossy.    
Spoon chocolate ganache over each cheesecake and place a whole strawberry on the top.
