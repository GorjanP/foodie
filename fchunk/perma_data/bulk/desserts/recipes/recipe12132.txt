Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate.    
Beat evaporated milk, squash, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; pour into pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until pie is set, about 30 minutes more.
