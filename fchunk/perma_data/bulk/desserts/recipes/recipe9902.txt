Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Arrange apples in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.    
Combine flour, oats, white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a bowl; mix in 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir in water and egg until smooth. Spread batter evenly over apple mixture.    
Mix remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over batter. Dot with butter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 45 to 50 minutes.
