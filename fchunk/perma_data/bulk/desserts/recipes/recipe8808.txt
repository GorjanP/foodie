Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, and sugar. Gradually add eggs and vanilla while mixing. Stir in the flour and salt. Drop cookie dough by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten with the bottom of a glass. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, until edges are delicately browned. Remove from cookie sheet immediately.
