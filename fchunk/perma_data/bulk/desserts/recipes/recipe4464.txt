Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).    
Beat egg whites with the salt until foamy.  Slowly add sugar, one tablespoonful at a time, beating after each addition  until the meringue stands in stiff peaks.    
Stir in vanilla and fold in chocolate chips.  Drop by teaspoonfuls on a lined baking sheet and place in preheated oven.    
After 2 minutes, turn off oven.  Leave meringues in oven overnight. Remove from pan and store in cookie tin  lined with paper towel.
