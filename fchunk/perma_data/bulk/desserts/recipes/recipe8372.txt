Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add eggs one at a time and mix until light and fluffy.  Sift together the flour, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and baking soda. Add dry ingredients to sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk and vinegar.  Mix well with an electric mixer for 2 to 3 minutes.    
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until  cookie feels firm.    
After cooling, cut cookie into 2 inch bars. Roll each bar in sugar and store in covered tins. This one of my favorite Christmas  cookie recipes.  Enjoy!!
