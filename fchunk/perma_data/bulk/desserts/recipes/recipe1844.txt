Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Combine flour, sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, salt, baking soda, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large bowl; mix well.    
Stir in the chopped apples until just combined.    
Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
