Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat coconut oil, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until light and fluffy.    
Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in another bowl. Gradually beat flour mixture into sugar mixture; stir in oatmeal and blueberries until dough is combined. Drop dough by the teaspoonful 2-inches apart onto baking sheets.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
