For cookies, cream margarine with peanut butter. Mix in sugar, then beat in eggs and milk.  Stir in baking soda, oats, and flour.    
To Make Filling:  Combine raisins, water, and lemon juice.  Heat until nearly boiling.  Mix sugar with cornstarch; add enough (cold) water to make a paste.  Stir into raisin mixture and heat until clear.    
Shape dough into walnut-sized balls.  Place on a greased cookie sheet. Using your thumb, indent the center of each ball, making a fairly good-sized hollow spot.  Fill with about a teaspoon of filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 10-12 minutes.
