Cream together butter, sweetener, and sugar in a large bowl, until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract. Stir in flour and baking powder. Cover and chill dough for at least one hour or overnight.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Roll out dough on floured surface 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1-inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cool completely.
