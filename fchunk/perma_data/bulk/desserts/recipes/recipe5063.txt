Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until volume doubles or triples, about 7 minutes. In the following order, add sugar, honey, flour, baking powder, green tea powder, and water to eggs, beating 15 to 30 seconds before each addition. Pour batter into a 9-inch cake pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
