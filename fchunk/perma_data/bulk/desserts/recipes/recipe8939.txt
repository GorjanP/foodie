Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.    
Mash the butter and sugar together in a bowl with a wooden spoon until the mixture is creamy and well blended, and beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir in the raspberry extract, almond extract, and milk. In a separate bowl, stir the flour and baking powder together until thoroughly combined, and gradually beat into the butter-egg mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips, and drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned at the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
