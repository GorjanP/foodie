Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Beat sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, rum extract, and brandy extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt; mix until dough is just combined.    
Mix colored sugar and nutmeg together in a small bowl.    
Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls; coat with colored sugar mixture and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are beginning to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
