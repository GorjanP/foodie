Cream the butter, sugar, molasses, and peanut butter in a large bowl.  Blend in the eggs and vanilla.  Mix the flour, wheat germ, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl.  Stir the dry ingredients into the creamed mixture, until evenly blended.    
Stir in the oats, raisins, choc chips, and nuts.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
Shape dough into large balls using 1/4 cup of dough per cookie.  Place on greased cookie sheets, leaving 3 inches between them.  Flatten slightly with a fork.  Bake for 15 to 18 minutes.  When done, the tops will still be soft to the touch.  Cool on the sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool.
