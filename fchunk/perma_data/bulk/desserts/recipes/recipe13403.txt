Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate.    
Beat corn syrup, white sugar, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed until well blended; stir in chocolate chips, pecans, butter, bourbon, and vanilla extract. Pour mixture into the prepared pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 45 to 50 minutes.
