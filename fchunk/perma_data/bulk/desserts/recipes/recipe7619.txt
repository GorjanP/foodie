Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl beat eggs with an electric mixer.  Beat in sugar.  Stir in dates, coconut, walnuts, vanilla and almond extract.  Spoon mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.    
Remove from oven, and while mixture is still hot, beat well with a wooden spoon.    
When mixture is cool enough to handle, form into small balls and roll in granulated sugar.
