Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan generously with oil.    
Whisk milk and egg together in a bowl.    
Sift rice flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Mix in milk mixture until well blended. Fold in dried fruit. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to brown, about 1 hour. Let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes, before slicing.
