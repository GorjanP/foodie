In a large bowl, combine the bananas, lemon juice, pineapple juice, yogurt, ice cream, rum and coconut milk. Ladle into a blender in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth. Refrigerate until chilled.    
Divide the cold soup among chilled serving bowls, and sprinkle sliced almonds over the top for garnish.
