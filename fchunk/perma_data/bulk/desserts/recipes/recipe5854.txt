Combine the yogurt and pudding mix in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in 2 cups of the mixed berries and the cereal until blended. Pour the yogurt and berry mixture into a 9 inch pie plate. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 hours.    
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 cup of berries in a medium bowl and slightly mash with a fork. Stir in the sugar and lemon juice. Set mixture aside at room temperature.    
Spoon chilled berry-yogurt mixture into serving dishes. Top with a spoonful of mashed berries, and whipped cream, if desired.
