Bring 2 cups coconut milk to a boil; stir constantly until oil begins to separate from the milk, about 30 minutes. Skim and reserve oil in a bowl. Reduce heat to medium-low and add 3 tablespoons sugar to remaining milk. Continue to cook and stir until milk becomes brown and crumbly, about 30 minutes more. Remove latik from heat.    
Grease an 8-inch mold or pie dish with reserved coconut oil.    
Heat remaining 2 cups coconut milk, cream-style corn, cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar, and corn kernels in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour corn mixture into prepared mold. Cool until maja blanca is set.    
Cover mold with a plate and invert maja blanca onto the plate. Slice maja blanca and sprinkle with latik.
