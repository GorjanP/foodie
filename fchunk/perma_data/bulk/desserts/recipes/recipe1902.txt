Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.    
Melt chocolate over low heat and let cool.    
In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy.  Slowly add salt and sugar a little at a time, until mixture stands in peaks.  Stir in vanilla. Fold in chocolate, coconut and nuts.  Drop by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Cookies should be soft in the center.
