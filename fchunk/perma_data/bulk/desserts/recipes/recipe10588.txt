Melt white chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, 10 to 20 minutes.    
Place candy canes in a food processor; pulse until powdery with tiny pieces. Stir candy cane powder into melted white chocolate until well mixed, thick, and somewhat lumpy. Add food coloring until desired color is reached.    
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon mixture, about 2 teaspoons per mint, onto the baking sheet, about 1-inch apart. Cool to room temperature and store mints in a resealable bag.
