Toast the French bread and break it into 2 inch pieces.    
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a lightly greased 8x8 inch baking dish, spread about half of bread pieces on the bottom of the dish; sprinkle with half of the raisins, nuts and cheese.    
Repeat with a second and final layer of bread, raisins, nuts and cheese. Put anise candies on top of mixture, if desired.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir brown sugar, cinnamon and water until it forms a syrup; pour half of the syrup over bread.    
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes and remove from oven; pour remaining syrup over bread and bake for another 15 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
