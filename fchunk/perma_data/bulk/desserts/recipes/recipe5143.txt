Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff, and set aside.  In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar.  Melt the chocolate in the hot water.  Beat in the egg yolks, then the melted chocolate, buttermilk, and vanilla.    
In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Beat into the chocolate mixture.  Stir in about 1/3 of the egg whites to lighten the batter and then fold in the rest gently but thoroughly.    
Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan.  Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour, or until the cake tests done with a toothpick.  Let cool on a rack.  Makes 16 servings.
