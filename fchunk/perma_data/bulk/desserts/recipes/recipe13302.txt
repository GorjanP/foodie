Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a 9 x 9 inch baking pan with parchment paper.    
In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. Add egg substitute, Vanilla Coconutmilk and melted coconut oil. Gently fold the chocolate and berries into the batter.    
Pour batter into the pan and bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until a knife comes out clean. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.
