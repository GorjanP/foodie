Line a baking sheet with waxed or parchment paper.    
Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, about 2 minutes. Mix 1/2 the crushed cookies into the melted chocolate. Stir in peppermint extract.    
Spread chocolate mixture evenly on the baking sheet. Sprinkle remaining cookies and crushed candy canes on top of melted chocolate.    
Let stand at room temperature until bark has hardened, about 2 hours. Break into random pieces using your hands.
