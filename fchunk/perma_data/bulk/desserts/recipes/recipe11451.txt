Bake cookies on bottom rack of the preheated oven until dry on the outside but still slightly soft in the centers, about 1 1/2 hours. Let cool completely before removing from baking sheets.    
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until melted, stirring until smooth.
