In large saucepan combine marshmallows and milk. Stir over medium heat until the marshmallows are completely melted. Chill until mixture holds its shape when dropped from a spoon.    
Slowly mix in the mint extract and chocolate extract and stir until all the ingredients are combined completely.    
Beat the whipping cream in a chilled bowl until it forms stiff peaks. Gently fold whipping cream into marshmallow mixture.  Add food coloring to desired color.    
Spread into pie crust. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Be sure to refrigerate any leftovers.
