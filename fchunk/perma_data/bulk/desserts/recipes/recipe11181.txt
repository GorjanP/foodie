Whisk the flour and 2 tablespoons of white sugar together in a small bowl until combined; set aside. Whisk together the egg yolks, milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a small saucepan until smooth. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat, and stir constantly. Once the mixture is warm, whisk in the flour mixture, and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk constantly as the sauce cooks to keep it from scorching. Once thick, keep warm over low heat.    
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Finally, beat in the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.    
Pour the hot sauce over the egg whites, and gently fold together using a rubber scraper until well incorporated. Do not mix vigorously, or the egg whites will deflate. Serve warm.
