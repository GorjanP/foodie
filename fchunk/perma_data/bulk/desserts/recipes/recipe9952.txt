Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Chop vegetable shortening into flour in a bowl with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk 1 egg with cold water and vinegar in a measuring cup. Use your fingers to make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour about half the egg mixture into the well; mix the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture. Mix remaining half of egg mixture into dough, stirring just until combined.    
Roll dough into an 10-inch circle on a floured work surface and fit the pie crust into the bottom of an 8-inch pie dish. Trim and flute the edges of the crust.    
Whisk maple syrup, 2 eggs, sweetened condensed milk, and brown sugar together in a bowl until brown sugar has dissolved. Pour filling into crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set and small spots of sugary crust form on top of the filling, about 45 minutes. Chill until cold and firm, 5 to 6 hours, before serving.
