Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Line a springform pan with phyllo dough and trim overhanging edges. Fill with blueberries.    
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Evenly spread egg white mixture over blueberries. Make a decorative pattern with a spoon, if you like.    
Bake in the preheated oven until meringue topping is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
