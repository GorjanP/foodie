Stir tangerine juice and lemon juice together in a saucepan. Whisk eggs and egg yolk into juice mixture until smooth.    
Heat juice mixture over medium-low heat. Whisk in 3 tablespoons coconut oil until well-combined. Add remaining coconut oil and cook, whisking constantly, until curd begins to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Spoon curd into small bowls or jars.    
Cook and stir coconut flakes in a small skillet over medium heat until lightly golden and toasted, 2 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. Top curd with coconut flakes and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
