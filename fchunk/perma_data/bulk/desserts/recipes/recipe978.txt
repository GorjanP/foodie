Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).    
Cream the butter, sugar and eggs well.  Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.    
Pour batter into tart shells, no more than half full.  Bake for 20 - 25 minutes.  Watch carefully!!--they'll burn quickly.  Filling will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks or so.  Liquid coffee creamer can be used for cream.  Use any good pie pastry for shells.
