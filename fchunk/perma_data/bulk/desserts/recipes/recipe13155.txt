Place white chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Pour about 1/3 of the melted white chocolate into a separate bowl and color blue with a few drops of blue food coloring. Keep stirring chocolate so it does not get hard.    
Dunk the lower third of each marshmallow into the blue chocolate and place marshmallow onto plates with the blue chocolate side up.    
Mix yellow food coloring into the remaining white chocolate. Add a little bit of red food coloring to the yellow until you get the right shade of yellow for your minions.    
Stick cake pop sticks into the marshmallows on the blue side and dunk marshmallows into the yellow colored white chocolate up to the blue line. Stick marshmallow pops into a piece of styrofoam or a stale loaf of bread. Stick 1 or 2 eyes onto the yellow part of the marshmallow pops while chocolate is still wet and allow to dry, about 2 hours.    
Draw black glasses and a mouth onto the minion faces with the black decorating gel. Draw hair on top of the marshmallows if you like.
