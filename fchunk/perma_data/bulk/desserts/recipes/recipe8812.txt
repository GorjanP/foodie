Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cream the butter with the yolk and vanilla.    
Place the sugar and the pecans in a food processor and grind to a fine texture. Add the wheat germ, flour, and the salt and process again just to mix. Add the pecan mixture to the butter mixture.    
Roll this dough into balls a little more than 1 inch in diameter. Place on ungreased sheets about 2 inches apart. Using your thumb, make a dent in the top of each ball.    
Bake until a little brown , 15-20 minutes.  When they come from the oven, use a spoon or another tool to open the dent you made ( it tends to close during baking). Let rest on the sheet for about 4 minutes and then remove to a rack. Cool completely. Spoon the apple butter into the indents and serve.
