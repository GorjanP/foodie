Melt chocolate chips in a saucepan over low heat.    
Blend raisins, chia seeds, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth; stir into the melted chocolate. Fold walnuts into the chocolate mixture; spread into a small glass baking dish, smoothing the top.    
Freeze in freezer until firm but not hardened; cut into squares to serve. Store in freezer.
