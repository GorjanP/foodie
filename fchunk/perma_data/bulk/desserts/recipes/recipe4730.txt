Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a cookie sheet.    
Beat together the eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla extract until well blended.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; and stir into the egg mixture until well mixed.  Fold in the chocolate chips and almonds.  Form two logs, three inches in diameter, and place onto the baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven and cut into 1 inch diagonal slices.  Lay the slices on their sides on the cookie sheet and return to the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove  to cool on a wire rack.
