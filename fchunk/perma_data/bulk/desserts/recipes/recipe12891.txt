Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan with coconut oil.    
Combine honey, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, allspice, cardamom, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg in a shallow bowl. Coat apple slices in half the honey mixture and arrange in the prepared baking pan.    
Combine remaining honey mixture, oats, and walnuts in a bowl; sprinkle mixture over apples.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
