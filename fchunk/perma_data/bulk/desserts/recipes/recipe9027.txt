Microwave 1 cup chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl on low in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until chocolate is smooth and warm, 1 to 3 minutes. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch.    
Beat cream cheese into melted chocolate until smooth; stir in wafer crumbs and raspberry jam. Cover and refrigerate until mixture is semi-firm, about 4 hours.    
Roll chocolate-cream cheese mixture into 1-inch balls and place on a baking sheet or platter. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.    
Melt remaining 1 cup chocolate chips in the microwave, 1 to 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Dip frozen chocolate balls into melted chocolate; allow chocolate to set before serving.
