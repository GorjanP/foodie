Heat cherries, 1 cup heavy cream, milk, sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat until mixture is steamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 15 minutes more.    
Pour cherry mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Transfer blended mixture to a large bowl and stir in remaining 3/4 cup heavy cream.    
Chill in the refrigerator until completely cold, about 2 hours; stir in amaretto liqueur, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Pour into the container of an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.
