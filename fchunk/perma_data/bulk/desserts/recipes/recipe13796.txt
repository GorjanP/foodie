Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Whisk flour, white sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cloves together in a bowl. Beat eggs and vegetable oil in a separate large bowl until creamy; mix applesauce into egg mixture. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients; stir until batter is smooth. Fold 1/2 cup walnuts and raisins into batter. Pour into prepared baking pan.    
Mix brown sugar, 1 cup walnuts, and chocolate chips together in a bowl; spread over the cake.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
