Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.    
Mix cream cheese, peanut butter, and sugar together in a bowl; form into 1-inch balls.    
Melt white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.    
Dip each ball into the melted white chocolate, using spoons to roll ball around until evenly coated. Arrange coated balls on the prepared baking sheet; refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
