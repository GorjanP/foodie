Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Scoop out the core from top of the apple, leaving a well.  Do not cut all the way through.  Stuff each apple with 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon butter.  Place in a shallow baking dish and sprinkle with cinnamon.    
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until sugar begins to caramelize and apples are tender.
