Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease an 8 inch pie pan.    
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Fold in crackers, 3/4 cup pecans, and vanilla extract. Pour mixture into pie pan.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until firm and lightly browned. Remove and cool.    
In a medium bowl, combine whipping cream and brown sugar. Beat until soft peaks form. Spread over cooled pie. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup pecans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
