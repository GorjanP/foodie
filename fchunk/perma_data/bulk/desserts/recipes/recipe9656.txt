Using your hands, combine the peanut butter, cereal, and 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl until well mixed. Roll into log shapes about the size of your little finger.    
Combine the remaining confectioners' sugar and water in a saucepan; bring to boil. Remove from heat and let stand a few minutes.    
Dip each log into glaze . Place on racks until glaze becomes firm. Store in airtight container with waxed paper between layers.
