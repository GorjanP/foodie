Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.    
Combine brown rice flour, almond flour, milk, carob powder, honey, vegetable oil, banana, eggs, vanilla extract, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; whisk together until well-mixed. Pour into prepared cake pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. If the middle is not baked through, lower the oven temperature to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C) and continue baking, about 10 minutes more.
