Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2- 8 or 9 inch round cake pans.    
In a medium sized bowl combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add water, shortening, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed until combined. Then beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Add eggs and melted chocolate and beat 2 minutes more. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans and let cool thoroughly on a wire rack.    
To Make Frosting: Beat butter until fluffy. Gradually add 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and the cocoa. Beat well than add the milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat in the remaining confectioner's sugar and any additional milk as needed for spreadability.    
To Make Filling: Drain cherries reserving 2/3 cup of the liquid. In a medium sauce pan combine reserved liquid and cornstarch, add fruit. Cook over medium heat and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for more 2 minutes and then stir in the orange or cherry liqueur. Remove from heat cover and cool without stirring.    
Arrange one cake layer on a serving dish and spread the cooled cherry filling over the top (reserve some cherries for a garnish for top of cake). Place second layer on top filling and frost sides and top of cake with frosting.
