Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place the pie crust into a pie plate, and arrange pear slices in the bottom. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.    
While the pears are baking, combine the pumpkin, soaked figs, and sugar in a blender or food processor. Process until smooth. Pour over the pears.    
Bake for an additional 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crust is golden and pears are tender. Serve warm or cold.
