Place coconut in a bowl; add sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Mix well. Refrigerate batter for 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.    
Loosely mold batter into 2-inch balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are evenly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a sheet of waxed paper to cool completely.
