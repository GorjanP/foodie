Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, combine the cake mix and crispy rice cereal. Stir in the egg and melted butter until everything comes together.    
Roll into firm 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart on an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool for 1 minute on the baking sheets before removing to cool completely on wire racks.
