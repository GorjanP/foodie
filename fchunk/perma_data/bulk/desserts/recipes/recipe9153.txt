Stir confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, and butter together in a bowl using your hands until well mixed. Shape mixture into 1-inch balls and arrange on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze peanut butter balls while preparing chocolate shell.    
Melt chocolate chips and coconut oil together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove double boiler from heat and set aside for 5 minutes.    
Remove peanut butter balls from freezer and dip each ball into the melted chocolate until evenly coated. Place coated peanut butter balls back on the baking sheet.
