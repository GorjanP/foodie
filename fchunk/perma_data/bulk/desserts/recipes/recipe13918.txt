Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Add carrots and milk; cook and stir until milk is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Add oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until carrots are softened and golden-orange, 7 to 10 minutes. Add sugar; cook and stir until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cardamom on top.
