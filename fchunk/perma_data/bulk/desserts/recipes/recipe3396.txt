Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease two 9 inch round pans.    
Combine sugar, flour, baking soda, water, mashed bananas, salt, and mayonnaise.  Mix together, and pour into the cake pans.    
Bake cake about 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove from oven, and cool on wire racks.    
In a mixing bowl, blend cream cheese and butter or margarine together.  Gradually add sugar and vanilla, and mix well.   Stir in nuts.  Fill and frost the cake.
