Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan.    
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, oil, and egg. Mix well. Stir in the blueberries. Pour into prepared pan. In a small bowl, combine 1/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in the margarine until crumbly. Sprinkle over cake.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
