Dissolve the baking soda in the water, and stir into the mixture along with the milk. Combine the flour, cream of tartar and salt; gradually stir into the sugar mixture. Fold in the almonds.    
Roll the dough into a log about 2 inches in diameter.  Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
