Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.    
Combine milk, vegetable oil, water, and egg in a bowl; whisk until well combined. Whisk in brownie mix, followed by pudding mix. Whisk until batter slightly thickens, about 2 minutes. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 1/3 of the way.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack as quickly as possible to prevent brownies from overbaking.
