Cut each banana half into 3 or 4 pieces.    
Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a shallow bowl.    
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; add banana slices and cook until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer banana slices to a paper towel-lined plate. Coat banana slices, 1 at a time, with cinnamon-sugar.
