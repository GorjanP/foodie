Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, combine the yellow cake mix, melted margarine and 1 egg. Mix until smooth, then spread evenly into the prepared pan. In a separate bowl, cream together the confectioners' sugar, 2 eggs and cream cheese until light and fluffy. Stir in the lemon cake mix, until well blended. Spread evenly over the first layer. Sprinkle with pecans.    
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted into the center, comes out clean. Cool and cut into bars.
