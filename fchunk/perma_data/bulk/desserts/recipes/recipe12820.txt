Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Toast slices of bread and cut into cubes. Place in a large bowl. Add brown sugar, graham crackers, almonds, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; mix to combine.    
Heat butter in a small saucepan over low heat until melted, about 3 minutes. Stir in almond extract.    
Spread half the apples and pear in the bottom of a 9-inch baking dish. Top with 1/2 of the bread mixture. Drizzle 1/2 of the butter mixture on top. Repeat layers once more with remaining ingredients.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are soft and bread topping is crunchy, about 1 hour.
