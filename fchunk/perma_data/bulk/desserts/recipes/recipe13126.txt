Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Melt white chocolate in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until the chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter.    
Place crispy rice cereal in a large bowl. Pour the chocolate mixture on top and stir until combined.    
Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Place in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour. Break into pieces by hand.
