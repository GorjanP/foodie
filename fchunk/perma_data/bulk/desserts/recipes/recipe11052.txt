Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the crisp rice cereal, brown sugar, flake coconut, mixed nuts, and melted margarine. Place half of the crisp rice mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.    
Cut the block of ice cream into 3/4 inch slices and arrange in baking dish, covering all of the crisp rice mixture. Sprinkle remaining crisp rice mixture over the top of the ice cream and gently press. Place baking dish in the freezer 15 minutes, or until set. Keep frozen until ready to serve. (Bars can be kept covered, in the freezer for 2 weeks.) Cut into squares and serve with thawed strawberries.
