Pack a large  bowl or baking dish full of clean, fresh snow. Smooth the top of the snow flat, and place it in the freezer to stay cold while you cook the taffy.    
Pour the maple syrup into a large saucepan, bring it to a boil, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until a candy thermometer reads between 235 and 245 F (112 to 118 C), or a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm ball.    
Pour about 2 tablespoons of syrup per piece over the snow in thin lines about 5 inches long. Let the syrup strips cool and become firm for 3 to 5 seconds. Pull the candy strips out of the snow, and then wind into a lollipop around the end of a wooden pop stick. Eat while still a little warm.
