Spray a small skillet with cooking spray; add sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Warm over low heat until they just start to brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a small bowl. Add peanut butter, almond flour, flaxseed meal, dark chocolate, and honey to the bowl. Mix well.    
Scoop out level tablespoon-sized portions of the mixture with a measuring spoon. Roll into balls with your fingers.    
Place shredded coconut in a shallow bowl. Roll each ball in coconut to coat. Transfer to refrigerator; chill until set, about 30 minutes.
