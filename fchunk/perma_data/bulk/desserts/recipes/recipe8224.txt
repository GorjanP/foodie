Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, cornstarch, and sea salt in a small bowl. Spread half of the persimmons into an 8-inch deep pie plate. Sprinkle with half of the the sugar mixture. Repeat with the remaining persimmons and sugar mixture. Set aside. Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter until evenly combined. Spread crust evenly over persimmons.    
Bake until crust is golden brown and persimmons are tender, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.
