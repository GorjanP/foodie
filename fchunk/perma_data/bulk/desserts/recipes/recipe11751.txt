Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Combine butter, 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in flour gradually. Fold mini morsels into the dough.    
Shape dough into 1 1/4-inch balls; arrange on ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar over cookies while still hot. Cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to finish cooling.
