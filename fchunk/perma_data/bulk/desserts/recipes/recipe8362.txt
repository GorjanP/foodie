Mix together the flour, sour cream and butter or margarine in a large mixing bowl.    
Flour a pastry board and your hands.  Make dough into small balls or roll them into 2 inch squares.  Add a small amount of pastry filling, any flavor you like.  Fold dough diagonally and press together.  If you make balls, press a small rim around the outside so the filling does not seep out.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 minutes and sprinkle on confectioners' sugar.   A wonderful gift any time of the year.
