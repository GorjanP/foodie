Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour five 16 ounce cans OR two 8 x 4 inch loaf pans.    
In a large bowl, mix sugar, oil, eggs, and beans until smooth.    
In a separate bowl combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and soda. Add to bean mixture, stirring just until combined. Stir in raisins and vanilla. Fill cans 2/3 full with batter, or divide batter into prepared loaf pans.    
Place cans or pans on a baking sheet.  Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.  Cool completely on wire racks before removing bread from cans or pans.
