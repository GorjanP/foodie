Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add the hot coffee, oil and vanilla, mix until smooth. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 45 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven. Test with a toothpick for doneness. Allow cake to cool before topping or frosting.
