Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.    
Beat eggs, almond butter, honey, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Sift coconut flour into the egg mixture while continually stirring. Fold raisins into the mixture. Drop mixture by the spoonful onto prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 14 minutes. Cool cookies slightly on sheet before moving to a rack to cool completely.
