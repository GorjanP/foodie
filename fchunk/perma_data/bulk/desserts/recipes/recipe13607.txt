Combine tofu and rice flour in a bowl; mix together by hand until smooth and slightly elastic. Pull dough thinly to test consistency; if it feels like your earlobe, it's ready. Add water or more rice flour as needed.    
Separate dough into 3 equal parts. Add red food coloring to 1 portion; mix by hand to evenly distribute the color. Note that color will intensify once dango are boiled. Mix another portion of dough with green tea powder; leave the last portion white.    
Separate each portion of the dough into 3 equal parts; roll into balls to make the dango.    
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop dango into the pot and boil until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue boiling for 2 minutes more.    
Remove dango with a slotted spoon and place into a bowl of cold or room-temperature water for 1 minute until just warm to the touch. Thread them through skewers in order of your liking. The traditional order is green, white, and pink.
