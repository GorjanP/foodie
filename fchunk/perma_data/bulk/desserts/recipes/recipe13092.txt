Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.    
Combine instant coffee and boiling water in a bowl.    
Melt chocolate tablets and butter in the top of a double boiler set over a pot of simmering water, about 5 minutes. Add coffee, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Mix the chocolate mixture and flour together in a second bowl.    
Beat eggs together in another bowl. Combine eggs and chocolate-flour mixture. Pour into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set and surface is glossy, about 20 minutes.
