Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a large bundt pan.    
Combine the cake mix, pudding mix, water, oil, and eggs together.  Mix with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.  Pour batter into bundt pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes, or until knife inserted in cake comes out clean.    
Combine the butter or margarine, sugar, and orange juice in a saucepan.  Boil this mixture for about 2 minutes.  While still warm, poke holes in the top of the cake with a fork.  Pour orange juice mixture over cake.  When the cake is saturated place it on a plate, and dust top with confectioners' sugar.
