Puree the blueberries and strawberries in batches in a blender or food processor.  Strain into a medium bowl,  through a sieve lined with cheesecloth.    
Stir brown sugar into berries.  Stir in soy milk until well blended.  Pour mixture into small paper cups, filling about two-thirds full.  Freeze until beginning to firm.  Insert wooden sticks and freeze until firm, 2 to 3 hours.
