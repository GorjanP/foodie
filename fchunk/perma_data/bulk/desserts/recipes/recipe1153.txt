In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening, sugar, egg, milk, almond extract and lemon zest.  Mix well after the addition of each ingredient. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; blend into the sugar mixture.  Fold in the blueberries. Cover and chill for 4 hours.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets, about 1 1/2 inches apart.    
Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
