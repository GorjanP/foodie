Line an 8-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil.    
Place chocolate in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.    
Pour evaporated milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in sweetener, 1/2 cup at a time, until dissolved. Add vanilla extract. Stir in chopped chocolate.    
Heat mixture in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total. Stir in walnuts.    
Spread chocolate mixture in the prepared pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.
