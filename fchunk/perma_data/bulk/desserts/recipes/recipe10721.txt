Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Spread pie crust pastries onto a flat surface and cut rounds from the dough using a 5-inch round cutter. Spoon 1 tablespoon blueberries into the center of each round; sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon sugar over each portion of blueberries. Dust blueberries with cinnamon.    
Fold dough over the filling and seal edges by pressing with a fork. Arrange pies onto a baking sheet. Brush tops of hand pies with beaten egg. Sprinkle turbinado sugar over the pies.    
Bake in preheated oven until browned, 18 to 20 minutes.
