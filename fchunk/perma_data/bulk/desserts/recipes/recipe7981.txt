Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Whisk flour and sugar together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until crumbly; press into a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.    
Mix sweetened condensed milk, egg, and almond extract together in a large bowl. Fold chocolate, toffee-flavored baking bits, and almonds into sweetened condensed milk mixture; spread over the warm crust.    
Bake until cookie bars are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator.
