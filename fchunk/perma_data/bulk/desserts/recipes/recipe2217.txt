Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  With a non-stick cooking spray, coat a 13X9X2 inch baking pan.  Dust with flour and set aside.    
In a small bowl, stir together the cocoa, confectioners' sugar, butter and 2 tablespoons hot water until smooth and set aside.    
In microwavable bowl, place peanut butter chips and shortening.  Microwave on high for 1 minute, or until chips are melted and smooth when stirred.    
In large bowl, combine cake mix, brown sugar, 1-1/4 cups water, eggs and reserved melted peanut butter mixture; beat on low speed of electric mixer until moistened.  Increase speed to medium, beat 2 minutes until smooth.  Remove 1-1/2 cups of the batter and add it  to the reserved cocoa mixture; blend well.    
Pour the peanut butter flavored batter into the prepared pan. Drop spoonfuls of the chocolate batter on top.  Swirl with a knife or spatula for a marbled effect.    
Bake at 350 degree F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool and frost as desired.
