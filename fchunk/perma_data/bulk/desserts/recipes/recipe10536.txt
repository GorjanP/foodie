Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup mini muffin pan and an 8-inch square pan with 1 teaspoon butter and 1 teaspoon flour each.    
Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat; stir in sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth. Fold in 1 cup flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt gently.    
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups using a small ice cream scoop, filling each 3/4 full. Pour remaining batter into the square pan.    
Bake both pans in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few crumbs attached, about 12 minutes for the mini muffins and 20 minutes for the square pan. Remove from oven and cool in the pan for 5 minutes.    
Transfer round brownies to a wire rack to cool. Let 8-inch pan of brownies cool in the pan, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 small squares.    
Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it almost boils, about 3 minutes.    
Place chopped chocolate into a bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate and whisk until smooth. Cool until thickened, about 2 hours.    
Place a dollop of ganache onto each brownie piece. Top each with 1 raspberry.
