Line a large pie dish with parchment paper for easier slicing and serving.    
Mix crushed biscuits and melted butter in a bowl. Press mixture into prepared dish and refrigerate for 30 minutes.    
Combine cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and sugar together in a bowl until well combined. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold into the cream cheese mixture. Reserve a few strawberries for garnish and fold remaining strawberries into the cream cheese mixture.    
Spoon the mixture over the chilled biscuit base and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Decorate with remaining strawberries. Chill for 1 hour before serving.
