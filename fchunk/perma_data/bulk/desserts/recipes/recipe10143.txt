In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar and peanut butter. Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Melt chocolate chips in the microwave or over a double boiler. Spread over the bottom layer and sprinkle with chopped nuts (if desired). Chill for 20 to 30 minutes, then cut into squares. Do not chill for too long or the top will crack when cutting which is not as attractive.
