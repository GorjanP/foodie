Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until smooth. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients, alternately with the milk. Once all of the ingredients have been incorporated, mix on high speed of an electric mixer for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
