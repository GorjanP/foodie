Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a large cookie sheet.    
In a large bowl,  cream the butter and sugar together. Add eggs and vanilla; mix until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Mix in the chocolate chips.    
Using a 1/3 cup measuring cup, drop cookies onto the cookie sheet. Be sure cookies are at least 2 inches apart. Insert a popsicle stick into each cookie, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
