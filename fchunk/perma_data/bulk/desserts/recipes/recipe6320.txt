Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare cookie sheets by covering with parchment.    
In a medium saucepan, heat the corn syrup, shortening and brown sugar over medium heat. Stir constantly until the mixture comes to a boil. In a small bowl toss together the flour and nuts; stir into the saucepan mixture, and remove from the heat.    
Keep the batter warm by setting over a pan of hot water. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be at least 3 inches apart. Bake for about 5 minutes, until the center of the cookie is set. Let the cookies set before removing from the baking sheets.
