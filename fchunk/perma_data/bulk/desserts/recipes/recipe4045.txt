Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a 9 inch pan, melt 3 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Arrange twelve pecan halves, then the apple wedges (as you would for a pineapple upside-down cake. Chop remaining pecans and set aside.    
In a small bowl, mix flour, baking soda, salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Set aside.    
Beat 3/4 cup butter and sugar until smooth and fluffy. Stir in water. Add flour mixture and mix just until combined. Fold in reserved nuts.    
Spread batter evenly over apples and bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.    
Cool 10 minutes, then invert onto serving plate.
