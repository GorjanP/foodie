Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth and light.  Add the flour, salt, and ground hazelnuts; stir together until well combined.  Chill dough for 1 hour, then drop onto greased cookie sheets in rounded teaspoons.    
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then roll in powdered sugar.  Cool completely on a wire rack, then roll in powdered sugar once again.
