Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)    
In a medium bowl, mix crushed cookies, 3 tablespoons melted butter and 3 tablespoons flour. Press firmly on bottom and side of ungreased 9 inch pie plate. Bake about 12 minutes or until light brown. Allow to cool.    
In a large bowl, combine white sugar, brown sugar, flour, and cream cheese. Beat on low speed until smooth. Reserve 1/2 cup of this mixture to swirl in later. To the mixture in the bowl, add vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger. Blend in eggs and pumpkin puree. Scrape bowl, and beat until smooth. Pour into crust.    
Stir 1 tablespoon milk into the reserved cream cheese mixture. Drop by spoonfuls over the pumpkin mixture. Use a knife to decoratively swirl the two mixtures together.    
Cover edge of crust with 2 to 3 inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning. Bake in preheated 35 to 40 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Remove foil the last 15 minutes of baking. Cool 30 minutes, then refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
