Put cranberries in a food processor and blend until well chopped.  Transfer cranberries to a large bowl, and mix in pineapple, pecans, marshmallows and sugar.    
In a medium bowl, beat cream with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into cranberry mixture.  Chill until ready to serve. (Or, freeze for 2 hours before serving.)
