Dip pretzel rods halfway into chocolate; shake off excess.  Roll rods in candies (one candy type per pretzel rod); place on prepared baking sheet.    
Place in refrigerator for about 30 minutes to harden.  Once hardened, remove from baking sheets and store, covered, in cool place with wax paper between layers.
