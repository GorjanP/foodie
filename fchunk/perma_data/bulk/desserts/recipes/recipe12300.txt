Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, about 5 minutes.    
Blend melted chocolate, tofu, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a food processor or blender until smooth. Add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to tofu mixture with the food processor on high until mousse is creamy and pudding-consistency. Pour mousse into a serving dish and refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes.
