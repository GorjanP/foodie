Combine dulce de leche and 1 3/4 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons heavy cream in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until thick and smooth. Cover and chill for at least 12 hours.    
Beat chilled mixture until semi-stiff peaks form and a mousse consistency is reached. Spoon or pipe mousse into shot glasses or small serving glasses.
