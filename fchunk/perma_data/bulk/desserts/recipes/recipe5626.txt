Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and line an 8 inch round or square cake pan.    
Sift together flour and baking powder once.    
In a medium bowl, beat butter or margarine and sugar for 7 minutes. (Color should be pale yellow. Do not overbeat.) Mix evaporated milk with vanilla; mix slowly into the sugar mixture.  Mix in flour one spoonful at a time until well blended. Pour into prepared cake pan.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
