Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.    
Fry bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until nearly crisp, about 5 minutes. Add honey and stir until the foaming subsides. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate to cool.    
Mix melted butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; mix in eggs.    
Sift flour, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl; add to the egg mixture. Fold bacon and chocolate chips into the mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Allow brownies to cool for 20 minutes before cutting into squares.
