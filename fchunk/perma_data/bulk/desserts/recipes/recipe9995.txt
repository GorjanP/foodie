Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 2 liter baba pan OR a 9 inch Bundt pan.    
In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, superfine sugar and vanilla sugar. Beat on high speed for about 5 minutes. Beat in flour. Reserve approximately 1/4 cup of batter and set aside. Pour remaining batter into prepared pan. Mix cocoa into reserved batter. Drop by spoonfuls onto the batter in the pan. Using a skewer or the tip of a knife, swirl the two batters to achieve a marbled effect.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
