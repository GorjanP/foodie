Put raisins together with rum extract and lemon juice to soak up the flavor.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the mashed potatoes, confectioners sugar, and cocoa. Stir in 1 1/4  cup coconut, the raisin mixture and lemon zest.    
Roll dough into walnut sized balls.  Roll the balls in remaining coconut. Refrigerate for two days. ENJOY!
