Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Combine pumpkin puree, tofu, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, vanilla extract, ginger, and cloves in a blender. Blend until silky smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. Pour mixture into pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.    
Refrigerate pie until chilled and set, 8 hours to overnight.
