Score pomegranate rinds lengthwise and crosswise with a knife. Carefully crack open with the knife. Break flesh into quarters with your hands, using scored lines as a guide. Hold each quarter over a large bowl and whack firmly with a wooden spoon to release seeds.    
Mash seeds in the bowl with a potato masher to release some juice. Add sugar and lemon juice; continue mashing to release more juice.    
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Mash into the pomegranate mixture in the bowl.    
Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until thick. Mash into the pomegranate mixture, popping seeds to reach desired consistency.    
Pour mixture into freezer-safe containers. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours.
