Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cake mix, butter, and egg together in a bowl until well combined; roll into balls and place on a baking sheet, about 1 1/2 inches apart.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies start to brown and crack, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to sit on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
