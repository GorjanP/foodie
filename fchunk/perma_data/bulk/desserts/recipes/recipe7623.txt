Place popcorn in a large shallow pan or dish.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring corn syrup and brown sugar to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in gelatin until dissolved.  Stir in peanuts.  Pour mixture evenly over popcorn, stirring to coat.  When mixture is cool enough to handle, form into 2 inch balls.  Let cool on waxed paper until set.
