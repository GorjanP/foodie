Place 2 cups flour in a bowl. Cut butter and cream cheese into flour using a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gently mix water into flour mixture until dough forms into a ball.    
Mix apples and cranberries with brown sugar, white sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until coated.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Roll dough onto a lightly floured work surface, forming about an 11-inch circle. Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Arrange apple-cranberry mixture decoratively on the dough, leaving a 2-inch rim of exposed dough. Sprinkle walnuts over apple-cranberry mixture. Fold exposed crust up and over the edge of the fruit.    
Brush egg over the crust and around the edge of the tart; sprinkle with raw sugar.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
