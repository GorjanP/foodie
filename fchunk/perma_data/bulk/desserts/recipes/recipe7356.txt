Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat together peanut butter and Pyure Organic All-Purpose Stevia Blend until well combined. Beat in egg, baking powder, Pyure Organic Liquid Stevia, Vanilla Flavor and salt until well combined. Bring mixture together into a ball, wrap in cling wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to handle, about 1 1/2 hours.    
Roll mixture into 16 equal balls. Place 2-inches apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Using tines of fork, press each ball, making cross hatch pattern on top of each cookie.    
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. Let stand on baking sheets 5 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely. (Cookies will be soft when baked and need time to set up on rack as they cool.)
