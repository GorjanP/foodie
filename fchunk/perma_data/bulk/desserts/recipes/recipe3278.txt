Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
Mix together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Whisk the sugar, butter, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Add the eggs and chocolate syrup; mix until evenly incorporated. Stir in the flour mixture and chocolate chips; stir until just moistened and pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
