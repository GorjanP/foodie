Cream the butter and sugar.  Add the egg yolk and beat thoroughly.  (This should be very creamy.)  Add the flour and cinnamon and mix well.    
Spread thinly on 1 1/2 cookie sheets.  Press down mixture with fingers, then score with a fork.  Brush on a film of egg white mixed with a little water.  Sprinkle the nuts over the top.    
Bake 1/2 hour at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).  Remove from oven and cut into squares or oblongs.  When cold, remove from cookie sheet.
