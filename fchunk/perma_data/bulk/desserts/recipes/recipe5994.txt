Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread pecans out on a baking sheet.    
Bake pecans in the preheated oven until fragrant and lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool completely and chop in a food processor.    
Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy; beat in egg yolk, vanilla extract, and salt. Slowly mix pecans into butter mixture. Stir flour into pecan mixture until dough begins to come together.    
Roll the dough into a ball and divide it in half. Roll each dough half into a 1 1/2-inch thick log. Wrap each log in wax paper and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet parchment paper.    
Unwrap dough logs and cut into 1/3-inch thick slices. Transfer slices to the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes.
