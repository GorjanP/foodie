In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Blend in chocolate and vanilla.  At medium speed, beat in eggs, one at a time, taking 5 minutes for each egg.  (This is very important, 5 minutes for each egg!)    
Spoon into pie shell and chill.  Top with whipped cream before serving, if desired.
