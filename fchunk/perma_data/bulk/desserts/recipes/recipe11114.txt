Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 (8 inch) pans. Sift together the flour, 1/2 cup cocoa, baking soda and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and cane syrup until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with 2/3 cup milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Frost between layers, on top and sides with Easy Chocolate Frosting.    
To make Easy Chocolate Frosting:  In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup cocoa and 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Remove from heat. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar and continue beating until spreading consistency is achieved. Beat in vanilla.
