In a medium size mixing  bowl, mix together 3 teaspoons baking powder and 3 1/4 cups flour.    
Beat together brown sugar and shortening then add eggs, orange rind and vanilla. Mix in flour mixture, alternating the flour mixture and sour milk until all is blended. Drop dough by teaspoonful onto cookie sheets.
