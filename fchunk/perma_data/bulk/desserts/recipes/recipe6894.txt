Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press the pie pastries into two 9-inch pie dishes.    
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and let cool.    
Beat potatoes, sugar, eggs, milk, margarine, vanilla extract, lemon extract, cloves, and allspice together in a bowl until smooth; pour into the prepared crusts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until pies are set in the middle, 40 to 60 minutes.
