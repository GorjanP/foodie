In a medium bowl beat eggs and sugar until light. Stir in the oil, vanilla,  melted chocolate. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the chocolate mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Refrigerate dough until firm. This will take anywhere from an hour in the freezer or overnight in the refrigerator.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Shape dough into 1 inch balls. Roll them in confectioners' sugar until heavily coated. Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets and bake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be firm to touch.
