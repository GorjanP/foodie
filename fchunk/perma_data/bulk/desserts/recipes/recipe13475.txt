Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray.    
Combine chocolate cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and beat batter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide batter between the prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 24 to 29 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Invert onto the wire rack; cool completely, about 15 minutes. Slice 1 cake into 1/4-inch layers. Reserve second cake for another use.    
Pulse chocolate sandwich cookies in a food processor in batches until finely ground.    
Combine cream cheese, vanilla pudding mix, and chocolate pudding mix in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in milk until evenly blended. Fold in whipped topping with a rubber spatula.    
Pour some of the cookie crumbs into the bottom of a 9-inch trifle bowl. Top with a layer of pudding, 1 layer of chocolate cake, and some gummy worms. Repeat layers twice more, ending with remaining cookie crumbs on top.
