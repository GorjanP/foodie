Halve peaches and remove pits.    
In a large bowl, stir Chardonnay, honey, brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon together.    
Add peaches, ensuring they are liberally coated by marinade. Allow to marinate for 1 to 2 hours.    
Preheat grill to hot.    
Lay peaches face-down over the grill for 4 to 6 minutes, or until exterior is seared and fruit is tender, basting with the wine-honey marinade. Remove peaches from heat.    
Coarsely chop pecans and lightly salt.    
Scoop vanilla bean ice cream into bowls. Immediately top with warm grilled peaches, a drizzling of the wine-honey marinade, chopped pecans, a dusting of cinnamon, and mint garnish.
