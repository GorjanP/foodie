Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Toast pecans in the preheated oven until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Chop coarsely.    
Combine brown sugar, butter, and shortening in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. Beat in vanilla extract.    
Sift gluten-free flour, 1 packet plus 2 teaspoons gelatin, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and ginger together in a bowl. Mix into the brown sugar mixture on low speed. Mix pecans, oats, and raisins into the dough.    
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.    
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 13 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
