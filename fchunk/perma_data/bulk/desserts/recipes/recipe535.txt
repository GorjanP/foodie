Beat eggs, and stir in raisins and vanilla. Refrigerate for at least an hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cream together shortening, brown sugar, and white sugar until light and fluffy. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in raisins and eggs, then stir in oats and walnuts. Roll dough into walnut sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in preheated oven, or until edges are golden. Cool on wire racks.
