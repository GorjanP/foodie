Custard: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease six 6-ounce (180 mL) ramekins and arrange on baking sheet.    
In a medium bowl or large glass measuring cup, beat eggs lightly with a fork. Add 2/3 cup (150 mL) brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, allspice, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Stir in pumpkin puree until blended. Slowly stir in evaporated milk. Pour evenly into prepared ramekins.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.    
Topping: Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons (30 mL) brown sugar, flour and 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) cinnamon. Add melted butter and stir in pecans.    
After baking custards for 20 minutes, remove from oven and sprinkle nut mixture evenly over custards and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until a knife inserted near the centre comes out clean.    
Transfer to rack to cool. Serve warm or chilled with a dollop of whipped cream, if desired.
