Grease two 3-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.    
Place all chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk into a large pot and cook over low heat, stirring until melted. Remove from heat and add in the Baileys. Stir until smooth and add in 1 cup hazelnuts and currants.    
Divvy the fudge between two 3-inch loaf pans. Sprinkle the tops with flaky sea salt and remaining 1/2 cup hazelnuts. Let fudge set at room temperature.    
Once set, remove from the pans, slice thinly, and serve on vintage plates.
