Grease a 9 x 13 inch pan.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, cream and butter.  Heat to soft ball stage, 234 degrees F (112 degrees C).    Remove from heat and stir in marshmallow creme and white chocolate chips; mix well until the chips melt.  Reserve 1 cup of mixture and set aside.    
To the remaining mixture add orange flavoring, yellow and red food coloring.  Stir well and pour into prepared pan.  Pour reserved cream mixture on top.  Using a knife, swirl layers for decorative effect.    
Chill for 2 hours, or until firm, and cut into squares.
