Preheat oven to 250 degrees  F (95 degrees C).  Place popcorn in a very large bowl.    
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.  Stir in brown sugar, corn syrup and salt.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Boil without stirring 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in soda and vanilla.  Pour in a thin stream over popcorn, stirring to coat.    
Place in two large shallow baking dishes and bake in preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, for 1 hour.  Remove from oven and let cool completely before breaking into pieces.
