Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Beat white sugar, 1 1/2 sticks butter, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl with electric mixer until fluffy. Add 4 cups flour, milk, and baking powder; mix until batter is thoroughly combined.    
Pour half the batter into baking pan. Spread half the boysenberry preserves over batter; pour the rest of the batter into pan and spread remaining preserves on top.    
Mix 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 1/3 cup flour in a bowl; cut in 2 sticks butter with a fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbles. Sprinkle crumbles over the preserves until covered.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool before cutting.
