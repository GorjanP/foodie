Mix strawberries and sugar together in a medium bowl until the strawberries are thoroughly coated. Allow the strawberries to macerate for 10 to 20 minutes.    
Cut the round watermelon slice into 8 wedges, and keep them together. Pat dry with a paper towel or clean dish towel.    
Spray or spoon the whipped cream onto the center of the watermelon round; don't be afraid to pile it on, as the cream will sink under the weight of the strawberries.    
Spoon the macerated strawberries and their juices over the whipped cream and serve immediately.
