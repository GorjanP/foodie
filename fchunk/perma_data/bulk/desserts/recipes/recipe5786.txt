Line three inch tart tins with pastry.  Chill while making filling.    
Melt butter.  Stir in golden syrup, brown sugar, raisins, nutmeg, and salt; mix thoroughly.  Let mixture cool. Beat the eggs just sufficiently to combine yolks and whites, and then mix into the butter syrup.  Pour filling into pastry lined tart tins.  Set tins on a cookie sheet.    
Bake on lowest rack in very hot preheated oven, 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), for 15 to 20 minutes.  When baked, loosen edges with pointed knife.  Allow tarts to stand for at least 10 minutes before removing from tins.
