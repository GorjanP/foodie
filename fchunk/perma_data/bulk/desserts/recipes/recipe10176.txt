Knead dough in a bowl, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if necessary, until a smooth, soft dough forms.  Divide dough into 8 balls 3 inches in diameter.  Place balls 4 inches apart on lightly greased cookie sheets; pat into 4 inch rounds.  Set aside, lightly covered with kitchen towels, about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
