Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 12-cup regular muffin pan with cooking spray; set aside. Pierce sweet potato with a fork 6 to 8 times; microwave on HIGH 5 minutes or until tender.    
Meanwhile, stir together 1/4 cup brown sugar, pecans and 1 tablespoon oil in small bowl until just moistened but still crumbly; set aside. In another small bowl stir together flour, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside.    
Carefully scoop flesh of sweet potato in blender container; discard skin. Add almond milk, egg and remaining 4 tablespoons oil; blend until smooth. Add dry ingredients to blender and blend just until moistened, scraping down sides as needed.    
Divide batter evenly between prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle with pecan mixture. Bake 20 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan 5 minutes. Remove and serve warm or cool completely on wire rack.
