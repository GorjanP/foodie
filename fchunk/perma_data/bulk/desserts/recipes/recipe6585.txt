In a large bowl, whisk together pudding mix and milk until smooth. Fold in 2 cups of the whipped topping, and sliced banana. Reserve 1/2 of banana pudding mixture, and spread the remainder into pie crust.    
In a small bowl, stir together hot fudge sauce and rum. Reserve 3 tablespoons in a microwave-safe container, for drizzling on top. With the back of a spoon, gently spread 1/2 of remaining fudge sauce over banana pudding in pie crust. Repeat layers with remaining banana pudding and remaining fudge sauce. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm.    
Arrange pineapple chunks in a single layer over top of pie. Spread with remaining whipped topping, swirling topping into peaks with the back of a spoon. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.    
In a microwave oven, heat reserved fudge sauce until pourable, about 10 seconds. Drizzle sauce with a fork over top of pie. Garnish with maraschino cherries and chopped walnuts.
