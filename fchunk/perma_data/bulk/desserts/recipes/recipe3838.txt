Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream margarine and sugar. Beat in the egg. Mix in the cinnamon, salt and flour; stir until smooth. Fold in the apples, then pour mixture into a 9 inch pie dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven for one hour. The pie will make its own crust.
