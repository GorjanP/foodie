In a bowl, mix all the ingredients together, except for the Nutella(R) hazelnut spread, for 1 to 2 minutes until the dough becomes workable.    
Roll out the dough between 2 sheets of baking paper until it reaches a thickness of around 1/8th of an inch.    
Cut out the dough using a cookie cutter or a stencil.    
Refrigerate for 30 minutes.    
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and position the baking rack in the middle of the oven.    
Transfer the cookies onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes. Remove from the oven and let them cool down on the tray.    
Fill a piping bag fitted with a small nozzle (about 1/16th of an inch) with the Nutella(R) hazelnut spread and pipe 1/2 tbsp of Nutella(R) hazelnut spread on half of the cookies and assemble with the other half.    
Finish your cutout cookies with Nutella(R) hazelnut spread.
