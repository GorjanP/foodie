In a 1 quart jar, layer the ingredients in the order which they are listed. Be sure to pack down each layer firmly as you go. Decorate the jar and attach a tag with the following instructions:    
To prepare Brownies, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch pan.    
In a medium bowl, combine 2 eggs, 2/3 cup of vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract; mix well. Gradually stir in the contents of the jar until everything is well blended. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.
