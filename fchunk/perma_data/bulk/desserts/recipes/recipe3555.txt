Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat the butter and maple syrup together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Stir the flour and salt together in a separate bowl; gradually mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just incorporated. Form the mixture into walnut-sized balls; flatten gently and arrange onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
