Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Beat eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until smooth; add ricotta cheese and mix well. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
