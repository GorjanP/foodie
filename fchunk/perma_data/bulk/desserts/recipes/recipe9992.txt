Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, mix together the butter, brown sugar, eggs and applesauce. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg; stir into the batter alternately with the cold coffee. Finally, mix in the raisins and pecans. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Cool and cut into bars.
