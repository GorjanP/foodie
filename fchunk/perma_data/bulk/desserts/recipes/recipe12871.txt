Mix orange juice, milk, granular sweetener, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Pour into a freezer-safe container.    
Place orange juice mixture into the freezer for 30 minutes. Stir well with a fork. Smooth out and level the top. Return to the freezer. Repeat, stirring every 30 minutes, until sherbet is frozen, 1 to 2 hours.
