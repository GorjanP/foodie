Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and eggs, then stir in the flour mixture.  Stir in the vanilla, pecans and dates.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cut into bars while cake is still warm.
