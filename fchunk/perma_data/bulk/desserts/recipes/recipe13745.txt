Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.    
Beat pumpkin, honey, shortening, water, egg, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until creamy. Whisk oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in another bowl. Add oat mixture to pumpkin mixture; stir until dough is well-blended. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 12 to 15 minutes.
