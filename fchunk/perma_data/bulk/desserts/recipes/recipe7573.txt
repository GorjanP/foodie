Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Blend in the egg, molasses and hot coffee. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon; stir into the molasses mixture until well blended. Mix in the raisins.  Pat the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for about 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. To make icing, combine butter, confectioners' sugar and cold coffee in a medium bowl; beat until smooth. Frost bars while warm, but allow them to cool before cutting.
