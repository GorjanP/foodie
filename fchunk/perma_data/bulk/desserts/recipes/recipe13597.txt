Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin tin cups with cupcake liners.    
Place 1 cookie in the bottom of each cupcake liner.    
Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a medium bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract until smooth. Pour batter over the wafers in the cupcake liners.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 15 minutes.
