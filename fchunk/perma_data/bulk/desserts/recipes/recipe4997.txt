Mix shortening, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in large bowl.  Stir flour, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl.  Blend dry ingredients in with the shortening mixture.  Mix thoroughly with hands.    
Divide dough into 3 parts; shape into cylinders, 1 1/2 inches in diameter and about 7 inches long.  Roll in colored sugar (or use finely chopped nuts instead).  Chill for several hours or overnight.    
Heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Cut into 1/4 inch slices, and place on greased cookie sheets.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool.
