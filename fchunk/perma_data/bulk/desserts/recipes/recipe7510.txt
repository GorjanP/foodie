Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).    
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the cranberries, raisins, sugar, water and flour. Cook until cranberries open and mixture thickens. Allow to cool and stir in butter and vanilla.    
Pour into prepared pie crust and cover with top crust.    
Cut slits in top crust and bake for 10 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 35 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown.
