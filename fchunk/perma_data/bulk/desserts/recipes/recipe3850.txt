Drain all of the juice from the pineapple into a large bowl. Set the pineapple chunks aside.    
Add the vanilla pudding mix to the pineapple juice and mix well until smooth. Stir in the pineapple chunks, mandarin oranges, and maraschino cherries. Mix well. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.    
Just before serving slice the bananas into the bowl and fold in.
