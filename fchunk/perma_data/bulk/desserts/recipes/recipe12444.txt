Beat 3/4 cup cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Spread a long rectangular layer of whipped cream, about 10 inches by 2 inches, onto a serving plate.    
Pour sherry into a flat-bottomed bowl. Dip a wafer cookie quickly into the sherry, spread one side of it with whipped cream, and stand it up on the layer of cream on the serving plate. Position a glass or can to hold the cookie up on the plain side, if necessary.    
Repeat, spreading cream on one side of a cookie and placing it next to the cream-covered side of the previous cookie. Continue until all cookies are used. Cover the cake with aluminum foil and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.    
Unwrap the cake. Beat remaining 3/4 cup cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Cover the cake on all sides with whipped cream. Sprinkle with grated chocolate and almonds.
