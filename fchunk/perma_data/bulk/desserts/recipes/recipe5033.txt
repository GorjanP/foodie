Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.    
In a small bowl, stir together the wafer crumbs and melted butter. Press into the bottom and a little bit up the sides of the prepared pan. Sprinkle on the chocolate chips, coconut and pecans so they are evenly distributed. Pour the condensed milk over everything.    
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the coconut is browned. Cool before cutting into bars. these are great frozen too. Cut into small squares - these are very rich!
