Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
Arrange crackers in pastry-lined pie pan and set aside.    
In medium saucepan, combine water, sugar, and cream of tartar. Stir well and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vinegar.    
Cool sugar mixture, then pour over crackers. Dot crackers with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover with second pastry shell. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cool and serve with ice cream or whipped cream if desired.
