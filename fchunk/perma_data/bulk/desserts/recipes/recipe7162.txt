Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 10x15 inch jelly roll pan.  Combine the flour, baking soda, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.    
In a small saucepan, melt 1 cup margarine.  Stir in water, 1/4 cup cocoa and 1 tablespoon instant coffee.  Bring mixture to a boil, then remove from heat.    
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.  Pour in the cocoa mixture, then stir in 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk, eggs and vanilla.  Mix until blended.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched. Allow to cool.
