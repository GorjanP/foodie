Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat until smooth.    
In medium bowl, combine flour and baking soda.  Add dry ingredients to creamed mixture; stir until a soft dough forms.  Stir in butterscotch chips and pecans.    
Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto a greased baking sheet.  Bake 7-9 minutes or until bottoms are lightly browned.  Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.  Store in single layers between waxed paper in an airtight container.
