Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with tahini.    
Combine boiling water and anise seeds in a glass measuring cup; let steep, about 5 minutes. Strain into a bowl; stir in sugar until dissolved. Discard anise seeds.    
Mix flour, turmeric, baking powder, and anise seed powder together in a bowl. Make a well in the center; mix in oil and butter. Stir in sweetened anise water until batter is the consistency of thick yogurt.    
Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Score top into diamond shapes with the tip of a knife; place 1 pine nut in the center of each diamond.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
