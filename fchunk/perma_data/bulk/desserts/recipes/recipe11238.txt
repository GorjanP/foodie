In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thoroughly  blended. Mix in the cream and melted butter. Sift together the flour, cinnamon and cardamom; stir into the egg mixture. Refrigerate dough for at least an hour.    
Heat goro iron and lightly coat with grease. On a floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into circles to fit your goro iron using a paper pattern. Place onto heated iron, close and cook, turning once, until golden. Carefully remove from the iron, and cut into thirds while still warm.
