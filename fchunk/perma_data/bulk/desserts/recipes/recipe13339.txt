Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Spread cashews on a baking sheet. Sprinkle coarse salt on top; drizzle with honey.    
Roast in the preheated oven until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool briefly, about 5 minutes.    
Grind cashews into a meal in a nut grinder or blender. Sift meal through a fine sieve. Repeat grinding process until meal has a fine, flour-like consistency.    
Mix oat milk, coconut oil, and eggs together in a bowl.    
Combine 3/4 cup cashew flour, brown rice flour, arrowroot powder, baking powder, guar gum, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, chili powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; pour in oat milk mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until batter is well blended.    
Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with coconut oil. Pour batter into the pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 32 minutes.
