Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a small baking dish, combine butter, sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, and milk until smooth.    
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine apples and cinnamon. Microwave until apples are soft, 2 to 5 minutes. Pour apples into the center of the batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until golden.
