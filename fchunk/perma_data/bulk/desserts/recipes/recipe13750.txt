Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl and set dry ingredients aside.    
Cream brown sugar, shortening, white sugar, and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Mix at medium-high speed until creamy and light. Blend in eggs 1 at a time until thoroughly mixed. Add vanilla extract and water; blend thoroughly.    
Add dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture slowly while mixing until completely incorporated. Reserve 1/2 cup chocolate candy pieces and fold remaining candies into batter.    
Drop batter by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased cookie sheets. Press a few reserved candies onto the top of each cookie.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Cool on a baking rack.
