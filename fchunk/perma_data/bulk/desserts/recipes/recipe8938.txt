In a large bowl, beat the cream, raspberry liqueur, vanilla extract, and confectioners' sugar together with an electric mixer until the mixture forms stiff peaks. Cut the cream cheese into pieces, and beat into the whipped cream mixture until fully combined.    
Layer half the pound cake slices into the bottom of a 9x9-inch square dish. Spoon half the raspberries and syrup onto the pound cake slices, and smooth on half the whipped cream mixture. Top with the remaining pound cake slices, remaining raspberries and syrup, and the rest of the whipped cream topping. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Serve cold.
