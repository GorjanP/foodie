Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch tube or Bundt pan. Sprinkle walnuts over the bottom of the pan.    
Mix together the yellow cake mix, 1/2 cup dark rum, eggs, 1/2 cup cold water, cooking oil and instant vanilla pudding. Pour batter over nuts.    
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.  Cool, invert on a serving plate and prick the top.    
To Make Glaze: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in 1/8 cup water and sugar.  Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove mixture from heat and stir in rum. Drizzle and smooth glaze evenly over the top and sides of cake. Enjoy!
