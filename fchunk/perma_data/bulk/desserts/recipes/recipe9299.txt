Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Grease a baking sheet.    
Beat egg white in a bowl with an electric hand-mixer until stiff peaks form.    
Gradually beat sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, into egg whites until fully incorporated. Stir salt and vanilla extract into egg whites until thoroughly mixed.    
Fold coconut and corn flakes into the mixture.    
Drop coconut mixture by the teaspoon onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly crisp, 20 minutes.    
Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool, at least 15 minutes.
