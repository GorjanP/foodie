Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine corn syrup, brown sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; beat thoroughly. Fold in cranberries and walnuts.    
Line a 9-inch pie plate with the prepared crust. Pour in cranberry and walnut mixture; smooth the top. Cover the rim of the crust with thin strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool before serving, at least 30 minutes.
