Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 cups of a muffin tin or line with paper muffin liners.    
Combine all-purpose flour, sugar, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl.    
Whisk egg lightly in a large bowl. Add applesauce, coconut milk, vegetable oil, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture until batter is just combined. Scoop into the prepared muffin pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
