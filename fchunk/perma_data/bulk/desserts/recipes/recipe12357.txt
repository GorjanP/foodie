Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and prepare with cooking spray.    
Sift whole wheat flour, baking soda, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, cream of tartar, and sea salt together into a bowl.    
Blend 1 cup palm sugar, eggs, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a food processor until smooth; add flour mixture and blend until the mixture forms a dough. Divide the dough into 24 portions and roll into balls.    
Mix 2 tablespoons palm sugar and 1 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in the sugar-cinnamon mixture, arrange onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart, and flatten slightly.    
Bake in preheated oven until browning along the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
