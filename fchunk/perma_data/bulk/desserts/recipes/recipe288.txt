Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
In a large bowl, combine bread, milk, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla and butterscotch chips; mixture should be the consistency of oatmeal.  Pour into prepared pan.    
Bake in preheated oven 1 hour, until nearly set.  (It should have a "thigh wiggle"  or wiggle as much as a well endowed thigh.)  Serve warm or cold.
