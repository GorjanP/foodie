In a small bowl, beat together eggs, coffee liqueur, and sugar.    
In a small saucepan, combine milk and coffee granules; heat over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until milk is steaming and tiny bubbles appear around edge of saucepan.  Beat milk into eggs.  Strain egg mixture through sieve into a pitcher.  Carefully pour egg mixture into tart shells, filling evenly (tarts will be very full).  Sprinkle each tart with a little cinnamon.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until filling is set and tart shells are golden brown.  Cool before serving.
