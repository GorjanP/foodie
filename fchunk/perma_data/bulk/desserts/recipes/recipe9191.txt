In medium bowl, mix peanut butter, confectioners' sugar and honey until blended. Knead with hands if necessary.    
Shape into 3/4 inch balls; place in jelly roll pan. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.    
When balls are firm, heat chocolate and shortening until melted and smooth under low heat. Remove pan from heat; let chocolate cool slightly. Carefully dip balls into chocolate mixture, then into chopped nuts to coat.   Place on waxed paper-lined pan; cover loosely and refrigerate until coating is  set- about 1 hour. Store in tightly covered container in refrigerator.
