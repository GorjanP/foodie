Place raisins in a small bowl and cover with rum.  Set aside.    
Prepare vanilla pudding mix according to package directions, using eggnog in place of the milk.  Stir in the heavy cream.  Chill in refrigerator until quite cold.    
Freeze eggnog mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.  Stir in drained raisins just before ice cream begins to set.  When ice cream is done, pack in a container and place in the freezer for 3 hours before serving.
