Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the bottom of a 7x11-inch freezer-safe baking pan.    
Melt butter and chocolate in a small pan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Add sugar and remove from heat. Stir in eggs one at a time. Add vanilla extract.    
Combine flour and cocoa powder in a bowl. Add the butter-chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Immediately place brownies in the freezer to lock in the moisture.
