Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a pie plate with 1 pie crust (defrosted if frozen).    
Combine apples, 1/2 cup sugar, caramels, flour, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Pile filling onto the bottom crust. Cover with the top crust. Poke small vent holes in the top of the pie. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar on top. Place pie plate on a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Place pie to a sheet of waxed paper.
