Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat butter and vegetable shortening with brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and maple extract until smooth; stir in flour and salt. Lightly press the dough into a 10x15-inch baking dish.    
Bake until the crust is set and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.    
Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove crust from oven and spread melted chocolate in a layer on top. Sprinkle with walnuts. Cut bars while still warm; let chocolate set, about 1 hour, before serving.
