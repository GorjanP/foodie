In a saucepan, combine the reserved raspberry juice, water, cranberries and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the skins of the cranberries burst.    
Remove from heat and add gelatin; stir until dissolved. Gently fold in raspberries, and pour into a 2 quart mold.  Refrigerate until chilled.
