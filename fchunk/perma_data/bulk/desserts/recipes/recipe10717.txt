Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat shortening, 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, peanut butter, egg, milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy.    
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture.    
Pour 1/4 cup white sugar into a shallow bowl. Wrap each chocolate kiss in about 1 1/2 teaspoons of dough and shape into a ball. Roll the dough ball in sugar to coat. Place each ball about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.    
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until chocolate softens and cookie is set, about 6 minutes. Flatten cookies immediately by pressing on them with the bottom of a glass.
