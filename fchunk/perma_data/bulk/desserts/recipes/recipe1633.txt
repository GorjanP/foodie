Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).    
In a medium saucepan combine sugar, cornstarch, pineapple with juice, and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened, then allow to boil 1 minute.    
Cool slightly and pour mixture into pastry-lined pie pan. Cover with top crust and seal. Make a few steam vents in crust, then brush with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Place in preheated oven and bake for 35 minutes. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
