Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread pecan halves on a baking sheet.    
Toast pecans in the preheating oven, stirring occasionally, until golden and fragrant, 6 to 10 minutes. Chop coarsely.    
Whisk corn syrup, sugar, eggs, melted butter, bourbon, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir pecans, dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips into the filling.    
Line a 9-inch fluted glass pie plate with pie crust. Brush milk over crust.    
Bake pie crust in the preheated oven until hot to the touch, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour filling into the hot crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and center is mostly set, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack; cool for at least 1 hour before serving.
