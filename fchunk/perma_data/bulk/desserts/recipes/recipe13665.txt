Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate, folding crust over the edge and crimping into place.    
Blend sugar, squash, milk, eggs, cinnamon, and salt together in a blender or with a whisk until smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared pie crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center is mostly set, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool to desired temperature.
