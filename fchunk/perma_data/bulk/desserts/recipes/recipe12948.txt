Cut marshmallows in half.    
Melt chocolate-hazelnut spread in a microwave-safe bowl, about 30 seconds.    
Pour cereal in a bowl; place a baking sheet alongside.    
Dunk each marshmallow half in chocolate-hazelnut spread, then coat with rice cereal. Place on the baking sheet; freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
