Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cut bread into 3/4 inch cubes.  Arrange pieces in a baking dish. Whisk together the eggs, egg white and sugar in a bowl. Stir in the milk, syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Pour mixture over bread.    
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned on top and middle is set, about 40 minutes.    
Warm the caramel sauce; drizzle over the bread pudding before serving.
