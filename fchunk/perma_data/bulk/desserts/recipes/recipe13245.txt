Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet.    
Bake pecans in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes.    
Combine toasted pecans, rolled oats, and peanut butter in a food processor or blender; blend, stopping to scrape down sides, until a thick "dough" forms.    
Microwave coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl until melted, 10 to 15 seconds. Stir in cocoa powder and maple syrup until smooth. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.    
Roll dough into 1-inch balls with your hands. Dip balls one at a time in the chocolate mixture using a spoon or fork, covering all sides. Transfer to the baking sheet. Let truffles sit, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle sea salt on top.    
Refrigerate truffles until set, about 20 minutes.
