Whisk water, sweetened condensed milk, and pudding mix together in a bowl until smooth and thickened, 2 to 5 minutes. Refrigerate until firm, about 5 minutes.    
Stir whipped topping and cream cheese together in a bowl until smooth; fold into the pudding mixture.    
Arrange a layer of vanilla wafer cookies into the bottom of a 2 1/2-quart glass dessert bowl. Top with a layer of banana slices, strawberry slices, and the pudding mixture, respectively. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients. Garnish with blueberries and raspberries to serve.
