Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line muffin pans with 24 Reynolds(R) StayBrite(R) Baking Cups.    
Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl.    
Combine the carrots, oil, applesauce, egg, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add carrot mixture to the flour mixture; mix just until combined. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups.    
Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes in muffin pan. Transfer cupcakes to cooling rack; cool completely.    
Top with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting, reserving a small amount. Make "nests" with the coconut. Dip jelly beans or candy eggs slightly into extra frosting and then place in the "nests" to keep them in place.
