Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 10x15-inch baking pan.    
Mix flour, 3/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt together in a bowl until crumbly. Press into the prepared pan.    
Bake crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Remove and leave oven on.    
Mix corn syrup, 1 1/2 cups sugar, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until blended. Stir in pecans. Spread filling evenly over the baked crust.    
Bake in the hot oven until filling is set, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely, and cut into squares.
