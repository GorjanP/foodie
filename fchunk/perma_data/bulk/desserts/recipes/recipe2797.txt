In a medium bowl, combine the flour and confectioners' sugar. Stir in the melted butter, egg, and vanilla until well blended. Cover, and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
