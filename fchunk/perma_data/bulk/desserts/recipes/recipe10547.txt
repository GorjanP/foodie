Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan.    
Boil peaches and nectarines 1 fruit at a time in a pot until very soft, about 30 seconds each. Let cool until ready to handle. Peel, core, and chop into bite-sized pieces.    
Mix the fruit, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Combine flour, brown sugar, coconut oil, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix with hands or a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the fruit mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and juice appears bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
