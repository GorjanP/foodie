Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Pour water into a large bowl; sprinkle tempura batter mix on top. Whisk until mix is moistened and large lumps dissolve; batter should be lumpy.    
Dip 5 banana slices into batter. Fry in hot oil until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining banana slices. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
