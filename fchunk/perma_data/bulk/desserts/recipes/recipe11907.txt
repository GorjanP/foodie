For the Santa hat cupcakes with sprinkles: Place some of the frosting into a piping bag with a large round tip. Pipe frosting perpendicularly to the center of the cupcake in the shape of a Santa hat, using gradually less pressure to create a cone shape. Cover cone with red colored sugar or red sprinkles. Spoon some frosting into a piping bag with a small star-shaped tip. Pipe frosting around the base of the hat for the rim and pipe a small pom-pom on top. Repeat with 3 more cupcakes.    
For the Santa hat cupcakes with strawberries: Frost 4 cupcakes with a thin layer of vanilla frosting. Place a strawberry in the center, with the tip facing up. Pipe a small pom-pom on top of the strawberry using the small star-shaped tip. Pipe frosting around the base of the cupcake using the large round tip to create the hat's rim. Create swirls in the rim with a finger. Repeat with remaining 3 frosted cupcakes.    
For the Santa hat cupcakes with fondant: Color white fondant with red food coloring. Sprinkle a work surface with confectioners' sugar and roll out 1/4 of the fondant into a very thin 2 1/2-inch circle. Cut a wedge from the circle, leaving a Pac-Man shape. Use the large round tip to pipe a cone of frosting in the center of each cupcake. Fold the cut edges of the fondant together to create a cone shape and place red fondant hat around the frosting cone. Use the star-shaped tip to pipe frosting around the base for the rim and a small pom-pom on top. Repeat with 3 more cupcakes.
