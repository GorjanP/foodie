Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.    
Mix butter, white sugar, and brown sugar by hand in a bowl. Add egg and vanilla extract; stir to combine. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into sugar mixture.    
Scoop the meat out of figs and reserve 2 tablespoons. Chop figs and scooped middles. Fold chopped figs and walnuts into the cookie dough.    
Drop spoonfuls of batter on the prepared baking sheet. Top each mound with small amounts of reserved fig pulp.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookie edges are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
