Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix cornflakes, butter, corn syrup, and sugar in a bowl until evenly combined; press onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drizzle crust with honey and cool in refrigerator, about 15 minutes.    
Stir cream cheese and marshmallow fluff together in a bowl until smooth and creamy; spread over cooled crust, keeping a 1/2-inch border of crust. Chill crust in refrigerator until completely cooled, about 15 minutes.    
Arrange strawberries, apricots, and kiwi over the cream cheese layer.
