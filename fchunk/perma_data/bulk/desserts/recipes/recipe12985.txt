Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine frozen mixed berries, apples, cornstarch, and vanilla extract in a bowl and transfer to a baking dish.    
Combine flour, oats, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix in coconut oil with your fingers until you have a crumbly dough. Sprinkle over the fruit in the baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crumble is lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.
