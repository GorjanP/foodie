Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cream the butter and the brown sugar until fluffy.  Add molasses and eggs and mix well.    
Combine flour, ground ginger, baking soda and salt and add to butter mixture.  Blend in fresh and candied ginger.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto parchment covered baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.  Bake about 10 minutes, or until lightly golden.  Cool.
