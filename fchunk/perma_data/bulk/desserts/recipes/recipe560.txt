In a large bowl, combine the pudding mix and milk until the pudding mixture thickens.  Fold 1 cup of coconut and half of the nondairy whipped topping into the pudding.  Pour the combination into the prepared pie crust.    
Spread the remainder of the nondairy whipped topping on top of the pie.  Sprinkle with the remainder of the coconut. Refrigerate, and serve chilled.
