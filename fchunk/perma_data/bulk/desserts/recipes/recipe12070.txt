Whisk mascarpone cheese, half-and-half, espresso, coffee-flavor liqueur, sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla bean paste gently in a bowl until smooth.    
Divide mascarpone cheese mixture among ice pop molds. Cover and freeze until slightly firm, about 1 hour.    
Insert ice pop sticks 2/3 of the way into the molds. Freeze until firm, about 4 hours more.    
Run molds under warm water to release and pull out ice pops.
