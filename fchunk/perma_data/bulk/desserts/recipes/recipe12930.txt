Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Combine oat bran, figs, walnuts, cashews, almond flour, coconut flour, cinnamon, and allspice in a bowl, making sure that figs do not clump together.    
Beat eggs in a separate bowl until thoroughly blended. Mix in coconut oil and vanilla extract.    
Pour egg mixture over oat bran mixture; mix until dough comes together.    
Measure dough into 1 1/2-inch balls with an ice cream scoop and flatten with a spoon to about 1/4-inch diameter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
