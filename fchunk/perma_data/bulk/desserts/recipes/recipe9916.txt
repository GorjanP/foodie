Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Stir the oats, flour, white sugar, brown sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and cinnamon in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the whisk attachment, cut the butter into the mixture until crumbly. Press about half of the mixture into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread the peanut butter over the oat mixture. Stir the jelly to make it spreadable and swirl into the peanut butter. Sprinkle the remaining oat mixture over the peanut butter and jelly layer; gently pat until it sticks together.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool completely before cutting into bars.
