Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 8 inch round cake pans.    
Combine the cake mix, instant vanilla pudding, cocoa, buttermilk, vegetable oil and the 3 whole eggs. Mix until blended and pour the batter into the prepared pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes or until the cakes test done. Set cakes aside to cool.    
In a medium sized sauce pan mix the evaporated milk, white sugar, 3 egg yolks and the butter. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is thick. Remove from heat and beat until partially cooled. Beat in the vanilla. Stir in the flaked coconut and the chopped pecans. Use to fill and frost cake.
