Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Roll pastry out onto a flat work surface. Line a tart tin with the pastry.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Leave oven on.    
Sprinkle semolina evenly over the pastry. Place plum halves on top in a circular pattern. Sprinkle brown sugar over plums.    
Return tart to the oven and bake until plums are tender and pastry is golden, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
