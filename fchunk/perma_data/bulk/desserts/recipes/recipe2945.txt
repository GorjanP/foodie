Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cut bread into 1 inch thick slices. Arrange bread slices and pecans on a baking sheet and drizzle with melted butter; toast lightly.    
In a large bowl, beat together eggs, cream, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar and vanilla. Put bread and pecans in a lightly greased 7x11 in casserole dish. Pour egg mixture over bread. Make sure that bread slices are saturated with liquid.    
Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, until golden. Serve warm.
