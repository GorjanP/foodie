Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
Pour pineapple with juice into prepared pan, spreading evenly to make the first layer.  Spread cherry pie filling over the pineapple layer, then spread the cake mix over the cherry pie filling.  Sprinkle the cake mix layer with pecans and mint chocolate chips, then distribute the sliced butter evenly over the top.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
