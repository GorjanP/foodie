Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Combine rhubarb, strawberries, white sugar, and 2 tablespoons flour in a bowl; spread into the prepared baking dish.    
Mix brown sugar, oats, 3/4 cup flour, and cinnamon together in a bowl; cut butter into brown sugar mixture using a pastry blender or 2 forks until crumbly. Sprinkle over rhubarb mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler is bubbling and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Serve hot or cold.
