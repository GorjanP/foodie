Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 1/3 cup of sugar until smooth. Mix in the walnuts, vanilla, salt and flour until well blended. Shape tablespoonfuls of dough into crescent shapes. Place 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet.    
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms begin to brown. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and cinnamon. Roll the cookies in the cinnamon sugar while still hot. Cool completely before storing in an airtight tin.
