Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray; dust with flour.    
Combine cake mix, sour cream, eggs, coffee-flavored liqueur, oil, pudding mix, orange zest, and cinnamon in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until very smooth, about 4 minutes. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared tube pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a plate; let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
