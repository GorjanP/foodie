Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Submerge nectarines for about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and let cool until safe to handle. Peel, halve, remove pit, and slice. Combine sliced nectarines, raspberries, and white sugar in a bowl. Transfer to a baking dish.    
Combine brown sugar, butter, flour, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl. Rub between your fingers to create streusel. Sprinkle streusel evenly over fruit.
