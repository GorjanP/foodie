Place oat cereal, confectioners' sugar, cashews, almonds, coconut, and cocoa powder in a food processor; blend to an even crumb texture.    
Stir rum and corn syrup together in a bowl; add cereal mixture. Stir until dough holds together. Add more rum if dough is dry. Form into balls and place on a plate.    
Chill rum balls in the refrigerator for flavors to blend, at least 1 hour. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.
