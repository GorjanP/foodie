Place almonds in the bowl of a food processor and grind into a fine flour. Add dates and blend until incorporated.    
Place coconut oil in a large microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave, about 10 seconds. Add almond and date mixture, 1 cup cocoa powder, water, agave nectar, chia seeds, and flax seeds and mix with a wooden spoon or spatula to form a stiff dough.    
Place 2 tablespoons cocoa powder and salt in shallow bowls. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Roll tablespoon-sized balls of dough with your hands. Coat with cocoa powder and then dip lightly in salt before placing on baking sheet. Chill or freeze until firm before storing.
