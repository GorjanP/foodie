In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and 2 cups of the sugar.  Add eggs one at a time and beat well after each.  Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and 1 teaspoon of the cardamom.  Add flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture alternately with the milk.    
In a small separate bowl, blend remaining sugar and cardamom. Dip rounded teaspoonfuls of dough into sugar/cardamom mixture.    
Place on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool on wire racks.
