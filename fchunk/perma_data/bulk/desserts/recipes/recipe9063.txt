Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Lightly coat baking sheets with cooking spray.    
Stack tortillas and cut into 8 wedges, to make 48 wedges total.  Arrange wedges in a single layer on prepared sheets and lightly spray with cooking spray.    
Bake in preheated oven until crisp and golden, about 10 minutes.  Slide onto wire rack to cool.    
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate.  In another small saucepan over low heat, melt caramels with water.    
Place a sheet of waxed paper under rack with tortillas.  Working with about 12 at a time, drizzle chocolate and caramel over tortillas using a fork.  Let stand on waxed paper to set.  You may need to remelt between batches.  When set, store in an airtight container between layers of waxed paper.
