Whisk together Almond Breeze, sugar, cornstarch, coconut oil, and extract in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes or until mixture has thickened, stirring frequently. Let cool, stirring occasionally.    
Place 2/3 of the mixture in a separate bowl and stir in orange juice concentrate. Combine mixture from both bowls and swirl very lightly.    
Spoon into ice cream pop molds and insert a handle or stick into each. Freeze overnight.
