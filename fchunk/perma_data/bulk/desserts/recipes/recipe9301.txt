Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place brownie mix, vegetable oil, water, and eggs in a bowl; stir 50 strokes with a spoon.    
Spoon the brownie batter into ice cream cones, filling them about 3/4 full. Place cones on an ungreased baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a brownie center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
