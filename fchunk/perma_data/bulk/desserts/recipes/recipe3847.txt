Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Beat the shortening, brown sugar, white sugar, egg, vanilla and milk until fluffy.    
Stir the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and instant coffee. Add to sugar mixture and mix thoroughly.    
Shape dough in 1 inch balls. If it's too soft, chill it for a while. Place balls 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Flatten to 1/8 inch thickness with fork or glass dipped in sugar.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees CV) for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned.
