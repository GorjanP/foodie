Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Core each apple making a large well in the center and arrange apples on a rimmed baking sheet.    
Mix oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; cut in butter until evenly combined. Spoon 1/4 of the oat mixture into each apple.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and filling is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
