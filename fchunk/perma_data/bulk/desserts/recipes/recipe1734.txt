Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare cake batter as directed on package for the light or low-fat version; set aside. Mix cream cheese, egg and sugar until well blended.    
Remove 3/4 cup of the cherry pie filling for garnish; set aside. Spoon 2 tablespoons cake batter into each of 24 paper-lined medium muffin cups. Top each with 1 tablespoon each of the cream cheese mixture and the remaining cherry pie filling. Cover evenly with remaining cake batter.    
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in centres comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes; remove from pan to wire racks. Cool completely. Top with whipped topping and reserved cherry pie filling just before serving.
