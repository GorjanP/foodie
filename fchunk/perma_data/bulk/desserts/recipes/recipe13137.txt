Mix wafer crumbs, butter, and white sugar together in a bowl. Press firmly into the bottom and sides of a 10-inch pie pan. Layer 1/2 the banana slices over the crust, starting at the center and working outwards. Squeeze a small drop of lemon juice onto each banana slice.    
Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in another bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Fold whipped topping into the filling until well combined.    
Spread filling mixture over the crust. Top with the remaining banana slices in a decorative pattern. Squirt the remaining lemon juice over the banana slices. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate until set, 2 hours to overnight. Drizzle caramel syrup over individual slices just before serving.
