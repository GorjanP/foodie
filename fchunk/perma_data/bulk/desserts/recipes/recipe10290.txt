Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat milk, shortening, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Stir 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt into milk mixture until dough comes together. Spread dough out into the bottom of a rimmed baking sheet.    
Spread apples over the dough on the baking sheet.    
Stir 1 cup sugar, melted butter, 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon together in a bowl until topping is combined. Sprinkle topping over apples.    
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and topping is golden, about 40 minutes.
