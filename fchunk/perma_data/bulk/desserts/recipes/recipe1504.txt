Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Soak raisins in hot water and set aside.    
In large bowl, sift flour with soda, salt and spices.  Blend in rolled oats, sugar and nuts. In a separate bowl, beat eggs with fork and add oil, vanilla, and raisins and water mixture.  Pour into dry ingredients, stirring until well mixed. Drop by teaspoonfuls about two inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake 10 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are golden.
