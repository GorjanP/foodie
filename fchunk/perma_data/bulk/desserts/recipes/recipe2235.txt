Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
In a medium bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar, hone and egg on medium speed, scraping bowl constantly, until smooth.    
Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Mix until just combined.    
Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased or parchment lined baking sheet. Bake until set and light brown around edges (surfaces of cookies will appear shiny), 7 to 9 minutes. Let stand 3 to 5 minutes before removing cookies to a wire rack to cool.
