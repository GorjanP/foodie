Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 9-inch glass pie plate with cooking spray; set aside. Stir together graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup sugar in medium bowl. Add melted butter; mix well. Press mixture firmly in bottom and up sides of pie plate. Bake 6 minutes or until golden brown and set. Cool completely, about 35 minutes.    
Meanwhile, stir together water, remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cornstarch in small saucepan. Add blueberries and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Cook 5 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; let cool 5 minutes.    
Spread blueberry mixture evenly over crust. Refrigerate 10 minutes. Spread softened ice cream over blueberry mixture. Freeze pie until firm, about 4 hours. Arrange strawberries over ice cream. Cut into 8 slices; top with Reddi-wip. Serve immediately.
