Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar, butter, shortening, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until thoroughly mixed; add egg and beat until creamy. Stir creamed mixture into flour mixture until smooth; stir in milk. Drop teaspoons of dough onto a baking sheet and flatten each with the bottom of a water glass. Sprinkle the tops of each cookie with enough sugar to cover the entire cookie.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes.
