Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch round pan and line bottom with parchment paper.    
In a large bowl stir together flour, 3/4 cup sugar, cocoa, instant coffee, baking soda and salt.  Beat in 1/2 cup softened butter, sour cream, egg and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in pan, then turn out onto a wire rack. Gently peel off parchment paper. Cool completely.    
To make the Fudge Nut Glaze:  In a small saucepan combine cream, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon butter, corn syrup, chocolate chips.  Cook over medium heat stirring constantly, until mixture boils.  Continue to cook stirring constantly for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool 10 minutes. Stir in nuts and vanilla.    
Place cake on serving plate. Pour glaze evenly over cake, allowing some to run down sides.  Arrange nuts on top.  Refrigerate until glaze is firm, about 1 hour.
