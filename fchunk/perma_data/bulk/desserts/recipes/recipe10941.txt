Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream together the brown sugar, white sugar, and butter until smooth. Mix in egg and vanilla. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the batter. Dough will be stiff. Mix in mini chocolate chips. Spread or pat dough onto an ungreased 12 inch pizza pan or cookie sheet.    
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown; let cool.    
Just before serving, spread cookie with whipped cream. Sprinkle with nuts, coconut and chocolate candies. Cut into wedges. Refrigerate any remaining pizza cookie.
