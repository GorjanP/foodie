Melt candy bars, sugar, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 5 minutes.    
Beat in eggs, one at at time, until smooth. Mix in flour and baking soda to create a sticky dough.    
Chill dough in the refrigerator until it can be easily scooped, about 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.    
Roll 1 1/2 teaspoonful of dough into balls. Place onto prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart.    
Bake in the preheated oven until brown and fluffy, 10 to 12 minutes.
