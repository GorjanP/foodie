Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Whisk flour, vanilla pudding mix, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.    
Puree strawberries in a blender or food processor. Measure 1/4 cup puree into a bowl. Mix in milk and vanilla extract.    
Combine sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to medium; beat in egg whites and whole egg until batter is just blended.    
Mix half of the flour mixture into the batter on low speed. Add milk mixture, Champagne, and food coloring; beat just until blended. Beat in remaining flour mixture until batter is just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula to make sure batter is smooth.    
Divide batter among lined muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 21 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
