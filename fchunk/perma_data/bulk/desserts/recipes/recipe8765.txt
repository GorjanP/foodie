Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Melt butter or margarine over low heat.  Remove from heat and add 4 cups of flour and the sugar.  Beat eggs in one at a time until it is all blended.  Slowly add in the remaining 4 cups of flour.    
Roll out the dough on a floured area to a thickness of about an 1/4 of an inch.  Cut cookies using cookie cutters and place the cut outs about 1 inch apart on the cookie sheet.    
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until brown on the edges.
