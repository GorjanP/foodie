Place the gelatin into a bowl, pour in the boiling water, and stir until the gelatin dissolves. Mix in the cranberry sauce, pineapple, celery, pecans, and orange zest until evenly blended. Pour the gelatin mixture into a mold or serving dish.    
Chill in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 8 hours.    
To make the topping, beat the cream cheese with half of the whipped topping. Fold in the remaining whipped topping until well blended. Unmold the gelatin, and spread with the topping mixture.
