Butter or grease one 8x8 inch pan.    
In a 3 quart saucepan, mix together sugar, milk, corn syrup, pumpkin and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and continue boiling. Do not stir.    
When mixture registers 232 degrees F (110 degrees C) on candy thermometer, or forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water, remove pan from heat.  Stir in pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, butter and nuts.  Cool to lukewarm (110 degrees F or 43 degrees C on candy thermometer).    
Beat mixture until it is very thick and loses some of its gloss.  Quickly pour into a greased eight-inch pan. When firm cut into 36 squares.
