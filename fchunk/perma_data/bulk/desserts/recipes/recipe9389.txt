Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch pan with aluminum foil, making sure to cover the sides and leaving several inches of aluminum foil on each end.    
Mix graham crackers and butter in a bowl until crackers are moist; pat down into the prepared pan.    
Bake in preheated oven until firm, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.    
Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add sweetened condensed milk; continue beating until incorporated. Blend sour cream and lemon juice into the cream cheese mixture. Chill in refrigerator for 20 minutes.    
Dip each vanilla wafer cookie in the brewed coffee for a few seconds and arrange in a layer onto the cooled crust with about 1/2 inch between each cookie. Spread about 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture over the cookies. Repeat layering of cookies and cream cheese mixture twice more.    
Refrigerate until center is set, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
