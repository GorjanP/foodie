Heat oven to 350 degrees F.    
Crush 22 cookies to form fine crumbs; mix with butter. Press onto bottom of 12-inch pizza pan sprayed with cooking spray. Bake 4 minutes; cool.    
Meanwhile, microwave semi-sweet chocolate and 1/2 cup whipped topping in microwaveable bowl on high 30 to 40 seconds or until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is well blended, stirring after 30 seconds. Cool slightly.    
Beat pudding mix and milk in medium bowl with whisk 2 minutes (pudding will be thick). Stir in remaining whipped topping; spread onto crust to within 1/2 inch of edge.    
Spoon chocolate mixture into resealable plastic bag; snip off small piece from one bottom corner of bag. Use to drizzle chocolate mixture in spiral motion over pizza. Gently drag toothpick through lines to resemble spider's web. Refrigerate 1 hour.    
Meanwhile, decorate remaining cookies with licorice pieces and candies as shown in photo, using frosting to secure pieces to cookies.    
Place decorated cookies on pizza just before serving. Garnish with sprinkles.
