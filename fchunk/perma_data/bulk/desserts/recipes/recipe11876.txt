Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Mix cookie crumbs and butter together in a bowl. Press crust mixture into a 9-inch springform pan.    
Beat cream cheese, eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. Spoon 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture into the crust.    
Break dark chocolate and milk chocolate into smaller pieces. Place dark chocolate and 1/4 of the milk chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.    
Stir melted chocolate into the bowl of remaining cream cheese mixture. Drizzle over the batter in the crust to make a swirl pattern.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set, about 50 minutes. Transfer cheesecake to a wire rack to cool cheesecake completely, at least 40 minutes.    
Place the cheesecake on a serving plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 2 hours to overnight.    
Melt the remaining milk chocolate using the double broiler, about 5 minutes. Combine with sour cream in a small bowl; spread over the cheesecake. Chill until frosting is set, about 5 minutes.
