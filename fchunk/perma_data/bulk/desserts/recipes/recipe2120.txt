Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, whisk together Splenda(R), oats, wheat flour, soy flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir in pumpkin, canola oil, water, egg whites, and molasses. Stir in flax seeds, if desired.  Roll into 14 large balls, and flatten on a baking sheet.    
Bake for 5 minutes in preheated oven. DO NOT OVERBAKE: the cookies will come out really dry if overbaked.
