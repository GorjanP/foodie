Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.    
Sift 1 1/4 cup flour, baking powder, pumpkin spice, and baking soda together in a bowl.    
Combine butter and brown sugar in a bowl; beat together with an electric mixer on low until light and fluffy. Whisk in eggs and yogurt; beat in carrots until well mixed. Add flour mixture gradually with the electric mixer until batter is combined.    
Beat cream cheese, white sugar, egg, 3 tablespoons flour, bourbon, and orange zest together in a bowl.    
Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan; spread with a spatula until even. Spoon cream cheese mixture onto the batter; smooth with the back of the spoon until even. Pour remaining batter onto the cream cheese mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
