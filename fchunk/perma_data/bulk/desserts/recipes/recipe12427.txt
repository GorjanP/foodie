Whisk the gelatin mix with the boiling water in a bowl until dissolved. Pour cold water into the gelatin mixture; stir. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl.    
Stick 8 2-inch straws around the mold to serve as the "legs," 4 on each side.    
Refrigerate until gelatin is set, about 4 hours. Poke 2 toothpicks into the gelatin to serve as the "eyes."
