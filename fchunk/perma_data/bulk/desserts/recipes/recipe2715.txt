Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with aluminum foil, allowing foil to hang over the edges.  Grease the foil.    
In a medium bowl combine confectioners' sugar, cocoa and cinnamon.    
Heat butter and milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  When butter is melted stir in vanilla.  Remove from heat and stir in sugar mixture and walnuts.    
Pour into prepared pan.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm.    
Lift foil out of pan.  Cut fudge into 2 inch squares, and then cut in half diagonally to make triangles.
