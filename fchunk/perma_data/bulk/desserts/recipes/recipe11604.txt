Combine eggnog, rice, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and salt in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes.    
Whisk half-and-half and egg together in a glass bowl. Whisk in some of the hot eggnog mixture. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan; cook and stir until pudding is thick, about 5 minutes.
