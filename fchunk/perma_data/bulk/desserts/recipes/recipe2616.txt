Preheat oven to 175 degrees F ( 80 degrees C).    
Arrange pretzels on a baking sheet. Place a candy kiss on the center of each pretzel.    
Warm pretzels in the preheated oven until candy kiss is shiny and slightly softened, 2 minutes.    
Place a candy-coated chocolate piece atop the candy kiss on each pretzel; press down. Chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
