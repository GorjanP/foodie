Place 4 ounces of the white chocolate in a microwave-safe dish. Cook for 1 minute in the microwave, stir, and continue to heat and stir at 15 second intervals until the chocolate is smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the melted chocolate, then fold in the whipped cream. Spread the mixture evenly in the bottom of the pie crust. Place the berries, point side up in the chocolate mixture.    
Melt the remaining chocolate, starting at 15 second intervals, in the microwave. Drizzle over the berries. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
