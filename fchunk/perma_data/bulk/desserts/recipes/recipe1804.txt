Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Beat together the egg whites with the salt in a small bowl until it forms soft peaks. Add the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time while continuing to beat at high speed until stiff peaks form. Continue to beat until glossy. Fold the coconut into the egg mixture. Drop mixture by the teaspoonful onto the prepared sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart.    
Bake in preheated oven for about 12 minutes.
