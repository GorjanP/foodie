Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Set aside.    
In a medium saucepan, heat sugar until it liquefies. Insert a candy thermometer and cook sugar without stirring until it reaches  320 degrees F (160 degrees C). It will be a clear, amber colored syrup.    
Add the water, cinnamon and cloves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer. Stir in vanilla.    
Layer in prepared casserole dish: half the toast, half the raisins, half the nuts, half the syrup, and half the cheese. Repeat layers. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Serve warm.
