Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Stir apples, 2/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together; distribute apple mixture into a 9x9-inch baking dish that is at least 2 inches deep.    
Whisk flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir egg, cream and melted butter together in a cup; pour egg mixture into flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are moistened. Using the back of a spoon, spread batter over apple mixture to seal apples in completely.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 50 minutes.
