Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9-inch spring-form pan.    
Blend tofu, cream cheese, maple syrup, coconut oil, cold butter, sucanat, cocoa powder, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a blender or food processor until smooth; pour into prepared spring-form pan.    
Cover the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil and place it into a pan at least 1 inch larger than the spring-form pan. Pour about 1/2 inch water into the larger pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until mostly set, about 1 hour and 20 minutes; cool at room temperature until just warm before chilling completely in refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
