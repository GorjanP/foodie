Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch pie plate.    
Blend eggnog, coconut flakes, sugar, flour, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract in a blender until well mixed; pour into prepared pie plate. Sprinkle nutmeg over the surface of the blended mixture.    
Bake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 45 minutes.    
Cool pie at room temperature until the pie plate is no longer hot. Refrigerate pie until chilled completely, at least 30 minutes.
