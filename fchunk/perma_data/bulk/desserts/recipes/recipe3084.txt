Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Grease a 14 x 18 inch cookie sheet.    
Sprinkle one package of chocolate chips on prepared pan. Place in warm oven until chips melt, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and spread melted chocolate over bottom of pan; set aside.    
In a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, combine butter and brown sugar.  Stirring constantly, heat to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.  Immediately remove from heat.  Stir in 3/4 cup slivered almonds and pour onto pan with melted chocolate; spread mixture evenly.    
Sprinkle remaining package of chocolate chips over the almond layer.  The heat from the almond layer will melt the chocolate chips; spread melted chocolate evenly.  Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup almonds over chocolate.    
Cut into squares, or allow to harden in a solid sheet and break it apart like brittle.  Cool completely before removing from pan.
