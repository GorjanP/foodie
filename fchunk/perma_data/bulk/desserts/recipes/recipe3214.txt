Beat egg whites until foamy with sturdy egg beater, or at high speed of electric mixer.  Then add 1 cup sugar gradually, beating only until meringue will hold up in soft peaks.    
In a large bowl, stir shortening just to soften. In another bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and 2 cups sugar; sift into shortening.  Add 1 1/2 cups milk and the extracts, and mix until all flour is dampened.  Beat 2 minutes at a low speed of electric mixer.  Add remaining milk and the meringue mixture; beat for 1 minute more.    
Line the bottoms of one 10 inch square pan and two 8 inch square pans with parchment paper.  Pour batter to equal depth in each pan.    
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 45 minutes, or until done.  Cool layers.    
Trim one of the 8 inch square cakes to make a 5 inch square cake.  Place the 10 inch cake on a large flat tray or plate.  Frost top and sides with thin layer of Ornamental Icing. Cover top of cake smoothly with more frosting.  Center 8 inch cake on top of 10 inch cake, and frost as above.  Center 5 inch cake on 8 inch cake, and frost.  Spread frosting over entire cake to give a flat, even base for decorating.  Decorate as desired.
