Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking pan. Place in the preheating oven to melt, about 2 minutes.    
Stir gingersnaps into the melted butter. Pat mixture down to form crust. Sprinkle orange peel, white chocolate chips, cranberries, and almonds evenly over the crust. Drizzle condensed milk evenly on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
