Sift together flour, ginger, cinnamon and salt.  Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Mix together shortening, sugar, molasses and egg until creamy. Mix in the flour mixture alternately with the cold water.  Mix in the baking soda and most of the walnuts, reserving a few to sprinkle on tops of cookies.    
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.  Bake these for 12 minutes or until done.
