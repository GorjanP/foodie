In a medium bowl, whisk together pudding mix and milk. Allow to set up 5 minutes, then fold in whipped topping. Gently stir in 1 cup of the crushed cookies and the chocolate chips. Spoon into crust. Sprinkle with remaining crushed cookies.    
Freeze overnight for best results. Remove pie from freezer 15 minutes before serving.
