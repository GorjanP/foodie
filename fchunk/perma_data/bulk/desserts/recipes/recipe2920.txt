Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish.    
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk. Mix well and pour into prepared pan.    
In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, water and butter. Bring to a boil and pour over batter in the pan. Sprinkle top with nuts and chopped apples.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Serve warm.
