Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish.    
Combine flour, brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl; mix in almond milk and butter.    
Pour flour mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with peaches. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is lightly browned and the peaches are bubbling, about 30 minutes.
