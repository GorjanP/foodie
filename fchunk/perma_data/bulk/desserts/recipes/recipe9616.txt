Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x13 baking pan.    
For the crust, combine all crust ingredients in a mixing bowl and combine until crumbly and butter pieces are no longer visible. Press the mixture on bottom of prepared pan.    
Bake 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned.    
For the filling, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese until light and creamy.    
Add Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip and mix until smooth. On low speed, mix in flour; add egg and vanilla and mix just until blended. Pour cream cheese mixture over baked crust. Arrange apple slices and press them into top of cream cheese layer.    
Bake 20-25 minutes. Allow bars to cool to room temperature.    
Cover and chill until firm. Before serving, spread Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip over top of bars.    
Cut and serve. Store covered in the refrigerator.
