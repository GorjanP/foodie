Bring milk, sugar, and cardamom seeds to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir broken vermicelli pasta and raisins into milk mixture and simmer until pasta is tender and the cream sauce has thickened, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until warm, about 15 minutes. If pudding is too thick, stir in a little milk.
