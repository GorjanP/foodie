Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan.    
Whisk together flour, baking powder, white sugar, 2 tablespoon cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl.    
Stir in milk and butter until smooth.    
Fold in walnuts until just combined.    
Spread batter evenly in the prepared baking pan.    
Mix 1/4 cup cocoa and brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture on top of the batter.    
Pour hot water over the batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the cake is almost set, about 45 minutes. Brown sugar, cocoa, and hot water will combine to form a chocolate sauce that will settle to the bottom of the cake during baking.    
Best served warm.
