Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine egg, sugar and peanut butter, mixing well. Roll dough into small balls and place on a cookie sheet. Flatten balls with a fork.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool on cookie racks. Variation: add chocolate or peanut butter flavored chips to the dough for an extra little twist.
