Pour boiling water over tea bags in a jar or pitcher, and allow to steep for 15 minutes.    
Remove tea bags, add sugar, and stir in lime juice. Adjust the sweetness to suit your taste and cool mixture to room temperature.    
Drop a lime slice into each ice pop mold. Pour in mixture, leaving about 1/4 inch space at the top. Place the sticks or tops in and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours.    
Run some warm water over the molds to help loosen the ice pops.
