Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie plate.    
Mound sliced apples in the pie plate. Sprinkle with orange juice.    
In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Scatter over the apples.    
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Serve warm.
