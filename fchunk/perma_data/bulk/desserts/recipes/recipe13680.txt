Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water. Soak for 1 to 3 hours. Drain.    
Combine soaked cashews, banana, ice cubes, tofu, cacao powder, dates, peanut butter, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon soy milk, and salt in a blender. Process until smooth. Add an additional teaspoon of soy milk only if needed, in order to keep the mixture as thick as possible.    
Pour into a bowl and sprinkle with crushed peanuts.
