Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter four, 4-oz oven-proof ramekins. Place ramekins on rimmed baking sheet. Set aside.    
In heatproof bowl over simmering water, melt chocolate with butter. Let cool slightly.    
In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk eggs, egg yolks with Pyure Organic All Purpose Stevia Blend, flour and salt until pale and thickened.    
With the mixer on low speed, gradually add chocolate mixture until well combined.    
Evenly spoon chocolate mixture into prepared ramekins.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until cakes have puffed and formed a light crust. Cakes will jiggle slightly when shaken. (Cakes should still be soft in center to retain soft flowing center)    
Meanwhile, whip whipping cream in bowl until soft peaks form. Add 1 tsp Pyure Organic All Purpose Stevia Blend; continue whipping for 1 minute longer.    
Run knife around edge of cakes and invert onto serving plate. Serve with dollop of whipped cream.
