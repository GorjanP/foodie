Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Grease a fluted tube pan with cooking spray and dust with flour; shake out excess.    
Place melted ice cream, cake mix, and eggs in large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and mix until smooth, about 2 minutes more. Pour into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the deepest part of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
