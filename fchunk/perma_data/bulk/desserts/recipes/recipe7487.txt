Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray a large cookie sheet with non-stick  spray.    
In a large bowl, with a mixer set on low speed, beat corn-oil spread and brown  sugar until blended.  Increase speed to high; beat until well combined, about 3 minutes.  At low speed, add egg whites, egg, and vanilla; beat until smooth.    
With spoon, stir in flour, oats, raisins, baking powder, and salt until combined.    
Drop dough by heaping tablespoons, about 2 inches apart, on cookie sheet.    Flatten dough into 3-inch circles.  Bake cookies 16-18 minutes or until golden   brown.  With a pancake turner, remove cookies to wire racks to cool for 15   minutes.  Store cookies in tightly covered container.
