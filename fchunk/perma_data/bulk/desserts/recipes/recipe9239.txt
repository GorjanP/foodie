Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Sift together the flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt, and baking powder. Separate the egg yolks from the whites.  Add the egg yolks to the flour mixture along with the apricot juice and vanilla and almond extracts. Beat on low speed of an electric mixer for about 1 minute.    
Wash beaters well before beating egg whites. In a glass or metal bowl (don't use plastic) beat the egg whites until fluffy. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.    
Gently fold the egg yolk-flour mixture into the egg whites about 1/4 at time.  Don't stir or cake will not be spongy. Gently turn batter into an ungreased tube pan.    
Bake for about 40 to 50 minutes. Immediately turn pan upside down and let cool. Once cake is cool remove it from the pan.
