Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat bottom and sides of an 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Place lentils and water in a blender; puree into a smooth paste.    
Transfer lentil paste to a large bowl. Mix in eggs, sugar, margarine, and vanilla extract. Stir in cocoa powder and protein powder until batter is thick and well-combined. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
