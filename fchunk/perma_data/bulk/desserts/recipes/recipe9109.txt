Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Butter a 1 quart baking dish or pudding basin.    
Melt chocolate over low heat in small saucepan.  Stir in milk and heat through.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.    
In a medium bowl, beat eggs.  Beat in 3 tablespoons sugar and salt.  Beat in chocolate mixture.  Pour into prepared dish.  Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel.  Place baking dish on towel, inside roasting pan, and place roasting pan on oven rack.  Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.    
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until set.    
In a clean, dry bowl, beat egg whites until stiff.  Beat in 3 tablespoons sugar and cocoa.  Spoon meringue over baked pudding and return pudding to oven to brown meringue, 2 to 8 minutes.
