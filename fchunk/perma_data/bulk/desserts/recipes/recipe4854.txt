Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Melt the butter in a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. Add the beaten eggs and milk; mix well. Tilt the baking pan to coat all of the sides with butter, then pour the excess butter into the batter, and mix until combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve hot.
