Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
Spread the rhubarb evenly in the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Sprinkle the sugar over the rhubarb, followed by the gelatin mix, and finally the cake mix. Pour the water and melted margarine over the top. Do not stir.    
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the rhubarb is tender.
