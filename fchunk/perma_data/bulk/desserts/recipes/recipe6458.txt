Place an oven rack in the lowest position in the oven and place a second rack in an upper position. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Beat brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into brown sugar mixture until combined. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans. Spoon small amounts of dough onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven on the lower shelf for 5 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to upper shelf; bake until edges are lightly browned, about 5 more minutes.
