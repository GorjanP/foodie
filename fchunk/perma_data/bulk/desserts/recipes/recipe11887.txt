Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking sheet lightly with cooking spray.    
Press cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove crust and let cool, about 5 minutes. Leave oven on.    
Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.    
Toast in the preheated oven until almonds start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool briefly and chop into desired size.    
Mix apricot preserves, peach preserves, strawberry preserves, and honey together in a bowl. Spread over the cookie dough in the pan. Spread almonds lightly over preserves.    
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over almonds. Let chocolate set, about 5 minutes. Cut into bars.
