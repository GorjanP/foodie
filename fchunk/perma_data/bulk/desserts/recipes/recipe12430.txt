Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a pie pan with cooking spray. Place pie crust in pan, trimming edges to fit.    
Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Combine sugar and eggs in a heatproof bowl and set on top of the simmering water. Add mango puree, melted butter, and lemon juice. Cook, stirring frequently, until filling is dissolved and thickened, about 15 minutes.    
Remove filling from heat and pour into prepared pie crust. Let sit 5 minutes. Arrange blackberries evenly on top of mango mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until semi-firm and starting to brown on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Chill completely before serving.
