Heat the Cointreau in a small saucepan until it begins to steam; add the saffron threads. Remove from heat and allow to rest for 20 minutes.    
Beat the cream cheese with an electric hand mixer  on low speed until softened. Slowly beat in the honey and orange zest. Add the saffron mixture and continue to beat.
