Roll dough into walnut sized balls. Place them two inches apart onto the cookie sheet and flatten slightly. Press ice cream stick into the flattened side of the cookie, and press down. This way, you know how large the cookie will be when baked. Add whatever topping to each cookie you like, OR, before pressing stick into the cookie, roll each cookie into sprinkles first, then flatten.    
Bake until edges are lightly golden.
