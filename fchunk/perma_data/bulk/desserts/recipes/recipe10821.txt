Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray lightly with cooking spray.    
Place avocados into a blender or food processor. Add honey and blend until a creamy mixture forms and no lumps remain.    
Add peanut butter, eggs, cocoa powder, and drink mix to the blender. Process until smooth. Add vanilla extract. Scrape down sides and blend until no powder is present.    
Pour batter into a large bowl. Mix in chocolate chips; batter will be sticky. Drop scoopfuls of batter onto the baking sheet. Press down slightly batter to make a cookie shape.    
Bake until center is no longer soft, about 12 minutes. Cool for 3 to 5 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a rack. Store cooled cookies in the refrigerator.
