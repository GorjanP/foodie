Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of milk, stir into the flour mixture.    
On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough out to the size of the prepared pan. Cover the inside of the pan with the dough. Spread dough with a light coating of egg white.  Fill with sliced apples and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Roll out remaining dough and place on top of apples.  Brush with a light coating of egg white.    
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is golden. In  a small bowl, beat together the confectioners' sugar, salt, vanilla and milk until smooth. Drizzle over cooled bars, cut into squares.
