Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a baking sheet.    
In a medium bowl, whip egg yolks and 3/8 cup of white sugar until thick and pale. Whisk in flour and salt just until smooth. Stir in vanilla. In a separate glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until they are able to hold firm peaks. Fold egg whites into the egg yolk mixture until fully incorporated.    
Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet, and shape into 3 inch long strips. Stir together the remaining white sugar and confectioners' sugar, and sprinkle half of the mixture over the tops of the strips. Let stand for 10 minutes, then sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over them, and let stand for 5 more minutes.    
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Cool on a wire rack.
