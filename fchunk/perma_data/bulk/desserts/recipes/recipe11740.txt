Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini muffin tin with cooking spray.    
Scoop up 2 teaspoons of cookie dough and roll into a ball. Place the ball in the prepared tin. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.    
Dip the bottom of a shot glass in flour and use to press each ball of dough into a cup shape; the top of each cup should be about 1/4 inch below the rim of the tin.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Press again with the shot glass to reinforce the cup shape. Continue baking cookie cups until very lightly browned, about 1 minute more. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer carefully to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until well blended. Add coconut milk and coconut extract; beat at high speed until frosting is light and fluffy. Add 1 tablespoon coconut milk if frosting is too thick.    
Spoon or pipe frosting into each cookie cup. Decorate with colored sugar, candy sprinkles, and shredded coconut.
