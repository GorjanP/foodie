Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with 1 tablespoon butter.    
Pulse 1/4 cup coconut, flour, brown sugar, and salt together in a food processor until just-combined. Add cold butter pieces to coconut mixture and pulse until mixture resembles wet sand. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon of coconut mixture into each prepared muffin cup and press into cup to create a crust.    
Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven, turn off oven, sprinkle chopped chocolate into each crust, and return to the oven until chocolate melts, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Divide remaining coconut between crusts. Freeze in the muffin cups until set, about 15 minutes. Gently remove each crust from the muffin cup with a thin spatula. Place a scoop of ice cream in each crust, drizzle dulce de leche over the top, and garnish with coconut.
