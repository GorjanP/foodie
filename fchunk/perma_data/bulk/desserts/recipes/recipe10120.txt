Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Prepare pie crust according to package directions for a filled one crust pie. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate chips until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.    
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar, and flour.  Mix with an electric mixer at medium speed until well blended.  Add melted chocolate, eggs, and 1/4 cup liqueur.  Mix well.  Fold in 1 cup whipped topping.  Pour filling into the pie shell.    
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool.    
Combine remaining whipped topping, 1 tablespoon liqueur, and the food coloring.  Spread over pie.
