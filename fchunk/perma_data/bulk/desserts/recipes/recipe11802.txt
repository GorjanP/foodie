In a bowl, mix together butter, honey and brown sugar. Mix in egg yolk.    
In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, gingerbread spice mix and salt; add to butter mixture and knead for 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap; and refrigerate for 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 320 degrees F.    
On a sheet of parchment paper, roll out dough to 1/6-inch thickness. Using small gingerbread-man cookie cutter or other small shaped-item (such as a glass), cut out gingerbread men.    
Transfer gingerbread men to parchment paper-lined baking sheet; bake on center rack for 8 to 9 minutes or until slightly golden.    
Let cool on rack for 15 minutes.    
Spread 1 1/4 tsp Nutella(R) hazelnut spread on the back of one gingerbread man then sandwich with another gingerbread man.    
Repeat with remaining gingerbread men and Nutella(R) hazelnut spread. Mix together confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, adding juice to the sugar, a 1/2 tsp at a time, to make smooth paste. Transfer to piping bag and decorate cookies with icing.
