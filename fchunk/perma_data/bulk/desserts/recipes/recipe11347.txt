Roll each piece of dough to about 1/8 inch thickness and cut with 2-1/2 inch round cookie cutter. Place rounds 1/2 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet.  Place (skimpy) teaspoon of filling on each round and fold in half. Seal edges with fork.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10-12 minutes or until light brown. Remove and cool.  Drizzle with lemon sugar icing made with 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice (fresh), 1 tablespoon water.  Mix until of drizzling consistency. If too thick, add a little more water, if too thin, a little more confectioners' sugar.
