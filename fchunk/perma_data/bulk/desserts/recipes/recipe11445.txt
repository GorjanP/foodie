Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a bread pan.    
Mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and cloves in a large bowl.    
Beat egg and milk together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture and stir to moisten dry ingredients evenly. Pour mixture into a bread pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
