Rinse quinoa in a paper towel-lined colander until water is no longer milky. Transfer quinoa to a saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups water and soak for 30 minutes.    
Bring quinoa and water to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.    
Blend bananas, whole milk, coconut milk, 3 tablespoons honey, butter, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt together in a blender until smooth.    
Stir milk mixture into quinoa, raise heat to medium; cook and stir constantly until pudding becomes thick, about 10 minutes.    
Transfer pudding to serving dish and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Drizzle 1 tablespoon honey over pudding; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.
