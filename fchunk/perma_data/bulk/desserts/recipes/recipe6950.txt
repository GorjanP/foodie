Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.    
In large bowl, combine oil, bananas, and vanilla until smooth.  Mix in oats, oat bran cereal and salt.  Fold in apricots and almonds. Drop dough by spoonfuls 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are light brown.
