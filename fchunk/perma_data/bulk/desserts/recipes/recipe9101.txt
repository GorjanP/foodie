Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Set aside. In a separate bowl, cream together margarine and sugar. Mix in flour, then 1/2 cup milk. Add egg yolks, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Mix until smooth, then stir in the remaining 1 cup milk.    
Gently fold egg whites into milk mixture. Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell.    
Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
