Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Combine almond flour, dates, cherries, walnuts, chia seeds, baking soda, and sea salt in a large bowl; whisk to blend. Add coconut oil, egg, maple syrup, and vanilla extract; blend well with a spoon or fork until dough comes together.    
Scoop dough onto prepared baking sheets with a small cookie scoop.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 minutes. Turn off oven and let cookies sit with oven door closed, about 10 minutes more. Remove from oven and let cool.
