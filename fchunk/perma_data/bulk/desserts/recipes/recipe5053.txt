Stir in egg and vanilla extract. Gradually mix in flour until just combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for 3 hours.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Roll the dough into 3/4-inch balls and arrange on an ungreased baking sheet. Press your thumb or end of wooden spoon into the center of each dough ball making an indentation. Spoon 1/4 teaspoon jam into each thumbprint.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies become lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.    
Place white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl; cook in microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chips are melted. Spoon melted white chocolate into a disposable decorating or plastic bag. Snip off one small corner of bag; drizzle white chocolate over cookies. Sprinkle with red sugar.
