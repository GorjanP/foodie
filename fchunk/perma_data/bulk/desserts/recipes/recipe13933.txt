Whisk cherry gelatin, orange gelatin, and 3 cups boiling water in a bowl until gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir 3 cups cold sparkling water into gelatin mix and chill in refrigerator until partially thickened, about 45 minutes.    
Meanwhile, whisk lime gelatin with 2 cups boiling in a bowl until gelatin is dissolved. Mix 2 cups cold sparkling water into lime gelatin. Let thicken slightly, about 30 minutes.    
Stir habanero pepper jelly into the thickened cherry gelatin mixture, transfer to a large trifle bowl, and chill until set, about 2 more hours.    
Halve, seed, and finely chop 1 habanero pepper, or to taste, wearing gloves. Stir chopped habanero pepper into lime gelatin mix, saving a few pieces for garnish. Spoon lime gelatin mixture over cherry gelatin to create a separate layer. Let the gelatin dessert chill until firmly set, about 2 more hours. Garnish with remaining habanero peppers to serve.
