Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 18 muffin cups.    
Roll out pastry and cut out 18 circles with a 3-inch round cutter. Fit one pastry circle into each muffin cup. Set aside.    
Place raisins in a large saucepan. Add enough water to barely cover raisins. Boil on stovetop until water is absorbed and raisins are soft. Cool partially, then stir in butter or margarine, sugar, nuts, and vanilla.    
After butter or margarine is melted and all ingredients are blended, stir in eggs. Mix well. Spoon mixture into pastry-lined muffin cups, filling each one 2/3 full.    
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until set in center and golden brown on top.
