Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.    
Cream sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Beat in eggs until blended; mix in vanilla extract. Beat in the flour mixture. Stir in peanuts and cherries. Spread mixture into a 9x13-inch nonstick baking pan; sprinkle with mini marshmallows.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set in the middle, 20 to 25 minutes. Cut into bars or use cookie cutters to make fun shapes.
