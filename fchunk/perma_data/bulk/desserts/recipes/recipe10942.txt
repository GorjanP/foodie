Sift flour.  Make a well in center, and break eggs into it.  Add salt, and knead until smooth.    
Roll dough out on lightly floured board until 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 1/2 inch strips, and cut strips into tiny pieces 1/2 inch long.    
With the palm of hands, shape these tiny pieces into balls the size of a filbert nut.    
Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Drop balls into oil 3 at a time.  Fry until lightly browned, turning them constantly with a wooden spoon.  Remove balls and drain them.    
Combine honey and sugar in saucepan and boil over low flame about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add fried dough balls,  1 cup at a time, and cook in honey syrup, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Remove and put strufoli on flat plate to cool.  Sprinkle with pine nuts and confectioners' sugar as soon as they are cool enough to handle, and mold about 5 together in a cluster.  Enough for 8, or so.  Strufoli will stay fresh for weeks if they are kept in a cool place.
