Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Spread pecans onto a baking sheet; spray pecans with cooking spray.    
Bake in the preheated oven until pecans are fragrant and toasted, about 5 minutes.    
Whisk flour, white sugar, and baking soda together in a bowl. Stir pineapple and its juice and eggs into flour mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in toasted pecans. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely.    
Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until icing is smooth. Frost the cooled cake using all the icing.
