Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.    
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and orange zest in a bowl. Set aside. Combine dates, apricots, raisins, walnuts, and cornmeal in a separate bowl. Set aside. Beat eggs, vegetable oil, 1/3 cup of orange juice, and molasses in a large bowl. Gradually pour the flour mixture into the egg mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the dried fruit mixture; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.    
To prepare the syrup: Mix honey, 1/3 cup of orange juice, and butter in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 1 minute. Stir in the orange-flavored liqueur. Poke holes throughout the cake then pour syrup over the cake.
