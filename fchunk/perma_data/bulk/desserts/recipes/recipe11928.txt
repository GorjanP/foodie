Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and dust with flour.    
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Add 1/4 cup sugar gradually, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form and sugar is completely dissolved.    
Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl until creamy. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until pale yellow and creamy. Fold into egg whites.    
Mix flour and baking powder in a bowl. Fold in egg mixture; add lime zest. Pour mixture into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 30 minutes. Turn off oven and keep the cake in the oven for another 15 minutes.    
Mix condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream in a bowl until well combined.    
Poke cake several times across the top with a fork. Pour three-milks mixture over cake. Refrigerate for 1 hour to allow milk mixture to soak in. Spread dulce de leche on top.
