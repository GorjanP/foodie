Melt the chocolate with the whipping cream.  Stir until smooth, and spread evenly over the bottom of the pie shell.  Refrigerate until ready to fill; chocolate should be firm before filling.    
Put the dry pudding mix and peanut butter in a heavy saucepan.  Over low heat, gradually stir in the milk using a wire whisk.  Stir constantly until mixture thickens and comes to a boil.  Cool for 15 minutes, stirring often.  Pour peanut butter filling into crust.  Chill several hours.    
Top with whipped topping and chopped peanuts if desired.
