Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Cream sugar and eggs together in a large bowl. Mix in applesauce and oil.    
Whisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl; add to egg mixture. Fold in carrot, zucchini, and 1 cup walnuts. Spread in the prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining walnuts.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
