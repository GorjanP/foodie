Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.    
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using a electric mixer until batter is smooth and well mixed, about 2 minutes. Mix bananas, cinnamon, and baking soda together in a separate bowl; stir into batter. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool cake completely.    
Beat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until smooth; fold in whipped topping until frosting is smooth. Spread frosting onto cooled cake.
