Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Mix cake mix, chocolate chips, eggs, and butter together in a bowl until just mixed; pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
