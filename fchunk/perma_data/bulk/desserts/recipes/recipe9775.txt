Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter, oil, and 1 1/4 sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 eggs, one at a time, then stir in the zucchini. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Pour half of the batter into prepared pan.    
Make the filling:  In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese, 2 tablespoons butter. Combine 1/4 cup sugar and cornstarch; beat into the cream cheese mixture until smooth. Beat in 1 egg, milk and vanilla. Pour over batter in pan, distributing evenly. Pour remaining batter over filing.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
