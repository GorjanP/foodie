Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Press the pie crust into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar and flour. Mix in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Gently stir in the blueberries. Pour into the pie crust.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the brown sugar, oats, flour and cinnamon. Mix in butter using a fork until crumbly. Spread the crumb topping evenly over the pie filling.    
Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until browned on top. Cool over a wire rack.
