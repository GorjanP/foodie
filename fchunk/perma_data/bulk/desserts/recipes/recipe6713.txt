Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9 x 13 inch pan.    
Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double-boiler, stirring sporadically.  When melted and combined, add the sugar and eggs, and stir until combined.  Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into the pan; stir until combined.  Stir in the nuts (or raisins, or M&M candies, or toffee bits, etc.).    
Spread the batter in the pan, smoothing it into the corners.  Bake for about 35 minutes, but don't let it over-bake.  Cool before cutting.
