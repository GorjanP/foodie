Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.    
Place a vanilla wafer into the bottom of each muffin cup.    
Beat cream cheese, sugar, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl until fluffy. Spoon mixture into the muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake filling is set, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours. Spoon 2 or 3 cherries from pie filling over each cheesecake.
