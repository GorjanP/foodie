Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and egg in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy.    
Mix flour, banana chips, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Blend into the creamed butter mixture. Dust your hands with flour and roll mixture into 3/4-inch balls.    
Arrange cookie balls on ungreased baking sheets. Press down on each ball gently with a fork.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
