Stir together the molasses and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until it begins to boil. Remove from heat and set aside to cool until cool enough to handle. Stir together flour, baking powder, ginger, cocoa powder, sugar, cinnamon, clove, cayenne pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Pour in the warm molasses mixture, and stir until a dough forms.    
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Refrigerate until the dough firms, about 10 minutes. Form dough into balls, using about 2 tablespoons per cookie. Place onto a baking sheet, and flatten slightly.    
Bake in preheated oven 8 minutes, then cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
