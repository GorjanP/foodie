Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 8-inch pans with parchment paper.    
In a large bowl, combine yellow cake mix, eggs, mandarin oranges with juice, and oil. Beat well.    
Divide batter into prepared cake pans. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly tapped. Allow to cool.    
While the cakes are cooling, make the simple syrup. Combine 1/3 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar in a glass measuring cup. Microwave for 1 minute. Stir to dissolve sugar. Pour about 1/4 cup orange liqueur into sugar-water mixture.    
Set one cake layer on a serving plate. Brush generously with orange syrup. Spread cake with frosting and layer drained mandarin oranges on top of filling. Carefully set remaining cake layer on base. Brush top layer with orange syrup. Frost top and sides of cake; decorate top with remaining orange slices, if desired.
