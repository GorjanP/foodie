Beat eggs and sugar until light and fluffy.  Grate squares of chocolate and add to egg mixture.  Add remaining ingredients and beat well.  Shape into a ball.  Chill in refrigerator at least one hour.    
Shape chilled dough into small balls (about 3/4 inch in diameter).  Roll each in sifted confectioners' sugar.    
Place balls on greased baking sheet and allow to dry in warm room (kitchen) for   4-5 hours.  Bake at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) for 3-5 minutes.  Cool on baking pan for 10 minutes.
