Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.    
Stir 1/2 cup melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl; add sweetened condensed milk and stir.    
Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl; melt in microwave on high for 90 seconds. Stir and continue melting in microwave in 30-second increments until smooth. Stir 2 tablespoons butter into melted chocolate until melted into the chocolate. Stir heavy whipping cream into chocolate.    
Pour chocolate mixture into sugar mixture; stir yogurt into the resulting mixture. Add flour and baking powder and stir to incorporate. Drop about a tablespoon of batter per cookie onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between each cookie.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are crispy, 15 to 17 minutes. Garnish each cookie with a pecan half and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.
