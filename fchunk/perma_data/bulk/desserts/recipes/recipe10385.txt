Mix flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and hot cocoa mix together in a large microwave-safe mug. Stir egg into flour mixture. Mix chocolate milk and vegetable oil into flour mixture until batter is smooth; stir in chocolate chips and vanilla extract.    
Cook in the microwave on high until cake rises slightly and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 3 minutes.
