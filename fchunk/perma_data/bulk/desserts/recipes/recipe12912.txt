Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well and let cool.    
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.    
Mash sweet potatoes with a potato masher or fork. Measure 1 3/4 cup of the mash into a large bowl. Add milk, sugar, eggs, butter, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Beat with a rotary beater until mixture has the consistency of cake batter. Pour into the pastry-lined plate.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool until center is set, about 15 minutes.
