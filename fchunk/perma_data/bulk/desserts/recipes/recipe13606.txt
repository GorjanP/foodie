Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.    
Roll puff pastry over a floured surface; cut into 1.5-inch squares. Place on the prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Transfer baked squares to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 5 minutes. Slice each square in half.    
Spread 2 tablespoons dulce de leche on half of the puff pastry squares; top with the other half of puff pastry square. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
