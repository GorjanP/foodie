Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Bring almond milk to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat; add chai tea bags. Let tea steep for at least 5 minutes.    
Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, ground flax seeds, cinnamon, vegetable oil, and salt together in a large bowl until completely smooth. Pour in chai-flavored almond milk; stir again until smooth. Pour filling into the pie shell.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
