Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Whisk sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl; stir in milk, lemon juice, egg yolks, and lemon zest until smooth.    
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold egg whites into flour mixture; pour into a 1-quart baking dish.    
Set baking dish in a baking pan. Pour water into baking pan to make a 1-inch deep water bath around baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle, about 50 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
