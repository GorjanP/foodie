Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour an 8 inch square pan.    
Cream butter or margarine and 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy.  Add salt and vanilla.  Separate eggs and reserve the whites.   Add egg yolks to the sugar mixture; beat until creamy.    
Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and baking powder; add alternately with milk to egg yolk mixture.  Coat berries with 1 tablespoon flour and add to batter.    
In a separate bowl, beat whites until soft peaks form.  Add 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form.  Fold egg whites into batter.  Pour into prepared pan.  Sprinkle top with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.    
Bake for 50 minutes, or until cake tests done.
