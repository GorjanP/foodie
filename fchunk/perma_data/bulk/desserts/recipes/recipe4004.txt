Drain pears and reserve 1 cup syrup; if needed, add water to equal 1 cup.    
In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine syrup and gelatin. Bring to a boil and stir until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from heat and chill until partially set.    
In a large bowl, blend the cheese and pears until smooth. Add gelatin mixture, pecans and whipped topping; blend until smooth. Pour into mold or leave in bowl. Chill for 3 hours or until firm.
