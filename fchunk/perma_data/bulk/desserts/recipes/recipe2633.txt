Coat a small cup muffin tin with cooking spray.   In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate with butter and oil, stirring often, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes.  Pour about a tablespoon of the chocolate mixture into each muffin cup.    
Melt peanut butter in microwave, 30 to 40 seconds.  Spoon about 1 teaspoon of melted peanut butter over chocolate in each muffin cup.  Top with another tablespoon of chocolate.    
Chill in refrigerator 30 minutes, until set.
