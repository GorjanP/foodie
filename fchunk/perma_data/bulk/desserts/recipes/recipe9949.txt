Stir coconut into boiling water in a large bowl.  Let sit for 15 minutes, then strain through cheesecloth, squeezing out all of the liquid to yield 3 cups.    
Stir together the cornstarch, sugar, nutmeg, and salt.  Bring the coconut milk to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Whisk in the sugar mixture, and cook until thickened, stirring constantly.  When very thick, remove from heat ,and stir in vanilla.  Pour into an 8x8-inch pan, and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until set.
