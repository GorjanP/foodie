Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and line with parchment two 9 inch round pans.    
Combine the crumbs, 1/2 cup pecans, flour, baking powder, and salt.    
In a large bowl, cream the butter and the light brown sugar until fluffy.  Slowly beat in the egg yolks, one at a time.  Stir in the vanilla.  Alternately add the milk and the crumb mixture while beating on low.    
Beat the egg whites in a bowl until foamy. Add the sugar slowly, and beat to soft peaks.  Fold into the crumb batter, and pour into the pans.    
Bake for 25 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.  Cool in the pans on a rack about 10 minutes, then invert and cool completely.    
To Make Frosting:  In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the 2 tablespoon sugar until it turns golden.  Remove from heat, and add 4 tablespoons of the butter; swirl.  Whisk in the dark brown sugar, and place back on the heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring all the time.  Add the cream, and bring back to a boil.  Boil 1 minute, and remove caramel from heat.    
Place the confectioners' sugar in a large bowl, and mixing on medium speed, slowly drizzle in the caramel.  Beat until the bottom of the bowl is just barely warm, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Beat until smooth, and chill frosting until ready to ice the cake.  Frost the cake, and press the pecans into the sides.
