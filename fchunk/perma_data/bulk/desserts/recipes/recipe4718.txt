Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl.    
Cream 1 cup of sugar with the softened butter until light and fluffy. Mix in the flour mixture alternately with the milk until no large lumps remain. Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange the berries over the batter, and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Pour the boiling water over top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the batter has firmed and the berries are soft, about 50 minutes.
