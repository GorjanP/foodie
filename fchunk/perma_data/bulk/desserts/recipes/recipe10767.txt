Cream together the butter, sugar, egg, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl.    
Stir in the flour and baking powder.    
Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.    
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Divide the dough into thirds. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/4-inch thick.    
Cut cookies out using a floured cookie cutter.    
Arrange cookies on an ungreased baking sheet about 1-inch apart.    
Bake until cookies are lightly golden, 6 to 9 minutes.    
Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
