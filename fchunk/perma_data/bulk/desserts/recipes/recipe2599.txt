Preheat broiler to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).    
In a medium mixing bowl beat together condensed milk, egg yolks, and lemon juice. Pour mixture into graham cracker crust.    
In a separate glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites with sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread evenly on top of lemon filling.    
Brown in preheated broiler just until meringue is set and golden. Keep pie refrigerated.
