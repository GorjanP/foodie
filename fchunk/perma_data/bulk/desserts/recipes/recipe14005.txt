Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.    
Mix bananas, oats, dates, applesauce, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with your hands. Stir in peanut butter until blended; mix in chocolate chips. Let dough stand until oats soften slightly, about 10 minutes.    
Drop 1-inch scoops of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet; flatten lightly. Sprinkle raw sugar on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
