Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch square cake pan.    
Mix baking mix, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup chopped pecans, and the instant coffee granules in a large bowl.  Whisk together the egg, shortening, buttermilk, and vanilla in a separate large bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mixing just until completely moistened.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Mix remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup chopped pecans, and the graham cracker crumbs in a small bowl.  Sprinkle topping evenly over batter.    
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Immediately dot top of cake with softened butter.
