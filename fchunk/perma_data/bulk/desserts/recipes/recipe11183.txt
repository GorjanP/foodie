Place the mango pieces and sugar into a blender. Puree until smooth. Add the lime and orange zest and juices along with the tangerine juice. Puree until evenly blended. Pour into a container, and refrigerate at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.    
Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, sorbet should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.
