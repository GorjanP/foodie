Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir brown sugar, corn syrup, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract into melted butter; cook until mixture begins to bubble, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, pour butter mixture over cereal, and stir to until cereal is coated. Spoon and press cereal mixture into muffin cups or a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
