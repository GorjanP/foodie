Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish with butter.    
Stir beaten eggs, cottage cheese, cream, sugar, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl; pour into prepared casserole dish.    
Bake in preheated oven until set and completely browned on top, about 1 hour. Set aside to cool.
