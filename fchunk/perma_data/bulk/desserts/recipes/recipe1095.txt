In a large, microwave safe bowl, combine sugar, cream, salt, margarine and pecans.  Microwave 9 minutes on high, stirring once.  Let rest 1 minute.  Stir in vanilla and continue to stir 3 minutes more.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto buttered waxed paper.  (If mixture is runny, allow to cool 30 seconds more and try again.)
