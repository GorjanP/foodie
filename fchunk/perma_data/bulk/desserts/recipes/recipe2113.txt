Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, sugar, salt, nutmeg, ginger, cloves and cinnamon.  Stir in the milk, then beat in the eggs one at a time.  Pour pumpkin mixture into the prepared pan.    
Sprinkle the yellow cake mix over the pumpkin mixture, then sprinkle on the pecans.  Drizzle melted butter over all.  Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. Allow to cool.
