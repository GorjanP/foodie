Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs until they are light and fluffy. Gradually add sugar and beat for about 3 minutes. Stir in the oil and anise extract. Fold in the dry ingredients until well blended. Spread the mixture into a 9x13 inch pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven.    
When the pan cools slightly, cut the cookie down the middle, lengthwise. Cut each half into 1/2 inch slices. Place slices onto a cookie sheet and return to the oven long enough to brown on each side, like toast. Store in a tightly covered container.
