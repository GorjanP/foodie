Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread butter in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan.    
Spread the rhubarb in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, and then with the strawberry gelatin mix. Cover with an even layer of miniature marshmallows. Prepare the cake mix according to package instructions. Spread on top of marshmallows.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
