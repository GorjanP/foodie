Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Butter each slice of bread on both sides.  Tear buttered bread into little pieces, and put into a very large mixing bowl.    
Beat eggs with vanilla, and then pour over bread.  Stir in half-and-half and sugar.  Pour into a  9x13 inch baking dish.  Sprinkle the cinnamon and nutmeg over the top.    
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool.  Serve hot or cold.
