Mix the strawberries with the mint in a bowl.    
Combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture reaches a thin syrup consistency, about 3 minutes.    
Drizzle syrup over the strawberries and mint and toss gently. Divide berries into four serving cups. Top each with ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a mint leaf.
