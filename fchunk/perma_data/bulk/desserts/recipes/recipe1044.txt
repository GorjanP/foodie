In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt.    
Add oil, milk, vanilla, coffee, and eggs; beat well.  Batter will be thin.  Pour into two 9 inch greased and floured round pans.    
Bake at  325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 25 minutes, or when top springs back when done.  Cool layers on wire racks.
