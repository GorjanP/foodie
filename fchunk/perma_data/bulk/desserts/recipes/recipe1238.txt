Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.    
In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, white sugar, oil, vodka, 1/4 cup liqueur, and water.  Beat for four minutes.  Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.  Cool on a rack.    
Make a glaze by combining 1/4 cup coffee liqueur and 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar. Turn cake over on a cake plate.  Poke cake several times with a fork.  Cover with glaze, and dust with remaining 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar.
