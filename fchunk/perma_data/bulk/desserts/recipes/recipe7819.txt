Combine the yeast, and the warm water; set aside to proof for 5 minutes.    
Cream 3/4 cup butter and sugar until light.  Beat in the eggs and yolks one at a time.  Add the vanilla, milk, sour cream, and yeast.  Beat until smooth.  Add the flour a little at a time to form a soft dough. Add all of the flour, and continue to beat until elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover and place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 50 minutes.  Can be placed in the refrigerator overnight instead.    
Beat down the dough, and divide into two pieces.  Place each in a buttered 9 inch square pan.  Brush the top of each with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.  Cover and let rise until doubled.    
For the glaze, place the brown sugar, 6 tablespoons butter, cream, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Boil for 30 seconds.  Remove from heat; add the lemon juice and almonds.  Let cool slightly.  Drizzle the warm glaze, not hot, over each of the cakes.    
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until the nuts are golden.  Cool on a rack.    
Split the cakes lengthwise using a serrated knife, and fill with the pastry cream.  Sandwich cakes back together and serve.
