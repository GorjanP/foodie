Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler, stirring constantly.    
Dip pretzel halfway into the white chocolate, completely covering half of the pretzel.  Roll in topping if desired, and lay on wax paper.    
Continue the process until all of the white chocolate is finished.  Place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to harden.  Store in airtight container.
