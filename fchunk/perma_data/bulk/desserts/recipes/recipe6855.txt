Stir together 6 tablespoons brown sugar, almonds and flour in small bowl. Cut in Parkay with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; refrigerate until ready to use.    
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 18 medium nonstick muffin cups with baking spray. Roll each pie crust into a 13-inch circle on floured work surface. Trim and discard edges to make two 10-1/2-inch square crusts. Cut each crust into 9 square pieces. Carefully press pieces into muffin cups; set aside.    
Combine apples, remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla in large bowl. Spoon 1/4 cup apple mixture into each crust-lined muffin cup.    
Bake 20 minutes. Top each with crumble mixture; bake 8 to 10 minutes more or until crumble browns. Cool in pan 5 minutes; carefully remove from muffin cups. Top each with Reddi-wip just before serving.
