Lightly grease a 1-quart mold.    
In a large bowl, dissolve gelatin in boiling water.  Stir in evaporated milk, sugar and coconut extract.  Allow to cool to room temperature.    
Meanwhile, whip egg whites until fluffy.  When gelatin mixture has cooled to room temperature, place gelatin bowl in an ice bath.  When mixture begins to set, fold egg whites into it.  Spread in prepared mold and refrigerate until set.
