In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine cream and milk.  Place vanilla bean and scrapings in pot, and sprinkle with half the white sugar.  Allow to just come to a boil.    
Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks together with the remaining sugar and the vanilla extract in a bowl.  When the cream is ready, pour a third of it into the egg mixture, and whisk.  Pour egg mixture into remaining hot cream and return to the heat until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon.  Do not boil.    
Strain custard and chill until cold.  Then pour into the canister of an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
