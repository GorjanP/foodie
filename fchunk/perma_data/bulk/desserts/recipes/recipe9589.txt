Place candy bars into freezer for about 10 minutes to firm; slice 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick.    
Line a 9-inch square baking dish with aluminum foil amd grease with butter.    
Heat sugar, 3/4 cup butter, and evaporated milk in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to melt butter and dissolve sugar. Bring mixture to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until a candy thermometer inserted into the middle of the syrup reads 234 degrees F (110 degrees C), 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir chocolate chips into syrup until melted and smooth. Stir marshmallow cream and vanilla extract into mixture to make a smooth fudge.    
Spread half the fudge into the prepared dish and layer the candy bar pieces over the fudge; pour remaining fudge on top of candy bars. Let cool to room temperature before cutting into squares.
