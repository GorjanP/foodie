Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Wrap each apple piece in one crescent roll.  Place seam side down in an 8x8 baking dish and sprinkle with cinnamon.    
In medium saucepan, combine butter, sugar, and orange juice; bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.  Pour over rolls.    
Bake for 30 minutes, or until pastry is golden and apples are tender.  Spoon sauce over rolls when serving.
