Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 42 miniature muffin tins with paper liners.    
Mix graham cracker crumbs with butter in a bowl until evenly combined. Spoon graham cracker mixture into the prepared muffin cups, pressing into the bottom and up the sides creating a crust.    
Place 1 chocolate square onto each crust and top each with 3 miniature marshmallows.    
Bake in the preheated oven until marshmallows are puffy and chocolate is melted, about 6 minutes.
