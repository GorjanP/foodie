Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.    
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.    
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until dough is just-combined. Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag, squeeze out excess air, and seal bag. Refrigerate until dough firms, at least 2 hours.    
Divide dough into 42 portions and wrap 1 dough portion around 1 mint. Repeat with remaining dough portions. Place dough 2-inches apart on prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are golden, 10 to 12 minutes.    
Melt remaining chocolate mint candies in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals in the microwave, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes. Drizzle melted mint chocolate over cookies.
