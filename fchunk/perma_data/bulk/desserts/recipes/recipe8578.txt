Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.    
Mix pumpkin, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl; pour into the prepared baking pan.    
Sprinkle cake mix evenly over the pumpkin mixture; top with pecans. Drizzle melted butter on top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.
