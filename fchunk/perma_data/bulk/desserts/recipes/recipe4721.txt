Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a small bowl. Beat 1 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add vanilla extract and eggs; beat well. Stir flour mixture into sugar mixture; mix well.    
Lightly flour hands. Shape about 1 tablespoon dough around 1 chocolate-covered caramel candy, covering it completely. Repeat with remaining dough and caramel candies.    
Place 2 tablespoons white sugar in a small bowl. Press one side of each ball into sugar. Place balls, sugar sides up, onto a baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookie is set and slightly cracked, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for about 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.    
Melt almond bark in a saucepan over low heat. Drizzle over cookies.
