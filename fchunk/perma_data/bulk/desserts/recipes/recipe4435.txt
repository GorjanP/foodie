Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, cocoa and baking powder; set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk. Mix well then stir in the vanilla and red food coloring.    
Pour batter into a 10 inch Bundt pan. Bake for 60 to 90 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
