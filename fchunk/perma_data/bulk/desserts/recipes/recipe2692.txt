Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)).    
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix apple pie filling, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into dry ingredients to make a batter; stir in walnuts. Pour batter into prepared tube pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 1 hour. Cool cake thoroughly in pan, at least 1 hour, before removing pan.
