Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter and 2 cups brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the maple flavoring. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the evaporated milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 70 to 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Decorate with Brown Sugar Frosting.    
To make Brown Sugar Frosting:  In a medium saucepan, combine 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla. Cook over low heat, beating until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth.
