In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, oil, white sugar and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt; stir into the sugar mixture until just blended. Cover and chill dough for at least 3 hours or overnight.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll the chilled dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in the remaining sugar. Place them 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheets. Press into each ball with the open end of a plastic thread spool. Dip the spool into the sugar between each cookie to prevent sticking problems.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Do not over bake or you will lose the delicate taste. Enjoy!
