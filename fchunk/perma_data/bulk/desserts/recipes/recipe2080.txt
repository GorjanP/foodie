Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until fluffy.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture.  Fold in the shredded apples.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 60 minutes, then turn out and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, if desired.
