Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.    
Line muffin cup liners with a layer of chocolate, about 2 teaspoons each.    
Mix almond butter and confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Roll mixture into 10 balls. Flatten balls and place onto chocolate layer, leaving an 1/8-inch rim at edges.    
Pour remaining chocolate over almond butter mixture to cover evenly. Set at room temperature until firm, 10 to 15 minutes.
