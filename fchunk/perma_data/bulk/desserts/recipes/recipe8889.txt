Place the shredded cucumber in a colander to drain. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gelatin mix and hot water until gelatin has dissolved. Mix in the sugar, salt and vinegar. Set aside to cool until it starts to set, about 1 hour.    
When the gelatin has thickened, stir in the mayonnaise, and fold in the drained cucumber. Transfer to a mold or serving bowl, and chill for 3 hours, or until set.
