Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).    
Mix chocolate cake mix, eggs, pumpkin puree, sugar, oil, water, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl; pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
