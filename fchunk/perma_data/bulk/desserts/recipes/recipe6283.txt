Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Mix mashed bananas, milk, egg, honey, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Stir in oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt.    
Spoon batter into mounds on the baking sheet, spacing them a few inches apart.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top looks dry and edges are golden, about 15 minutes.
