Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and cut excess crust from edges; fill with rice or pie weights.    
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.    
Beat eggnog, sugar, cornstarch, eggs, egg whites, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth; pour into crust.    
Bake until pie is set in the middle, 50 to 60 minutes.
