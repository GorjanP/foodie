Lay a sheet of wax paper on a work surface.    
Place graham cracker crumbs in a bowl. Place peanuts in a separate bowl.    
Insert 1 pretzel stick into each marshmallow, almost all the way through.    
Melt chocolate coating in a microwave-safe 2-cup glass measuring cup in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Dip the marshmallows into the melted chocolate; pull out and twirl to remove excess coating.    
Spoon graham cracker crumbs over the coated marshmallows; turn to let excess crumbs fall into the bowl. Repeat with peanuts. Set s'mores on the waxed paper to dry, about 35 minutes.
