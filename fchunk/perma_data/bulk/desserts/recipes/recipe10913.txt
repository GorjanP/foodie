Slice lemons as thin as possible, leaving on the rind. Combine with sugar; mix well.  Let stand at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.    
Beat the eggs well, and add to lemon mixture; mix well.  Place in a 9-inch pie shell, arranging the lemon slices evenly.  Cover with top crust.  Cut slits near center.    
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 12 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Bake for about 20 minute more, or until knife inserted comes out clean. Cool before serving.
