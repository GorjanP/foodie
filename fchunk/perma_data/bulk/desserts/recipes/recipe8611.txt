Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Combine applesauce, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to the egg mixture, alternating with buttermilk just until batter is moistened. Fold coconut and walnuts into batter; pour into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Dust coffeecake with confectioners' sugar.
