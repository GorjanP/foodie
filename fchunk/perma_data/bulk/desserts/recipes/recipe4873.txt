Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the bottom and sides of 9x13 inch pan.    
Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl; set aside.    
In a large mixing bowl blend butter, shortening, white sugar, brown sugar and vanilla together until creamed. Stir in the eggs, one at a time. Blend flour mixture into sugar mixture. Fold in chocolate chips.    
Spread 2/3 of the dough mixture evenly in pan. Cover top with 8 ounces raspberry preserves. Dot remaining dough randomly over the jam.    
Bake in the center of the oven for 30 minutes, or until done all the way through. Cool, cut, serve and enjoy!
