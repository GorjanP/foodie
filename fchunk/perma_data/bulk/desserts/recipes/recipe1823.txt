In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and butter or margarine until fluffy.  Add egg and egg white; beat well.  Stir together flours, soda, and salt; beat into creamed mixture.    
In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon.  Shape dough into walnut sized balls, and roll in cinnamon sugar.  Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes.  Cookies will puff up and flatten as they bake.  Cool on wire racks.
