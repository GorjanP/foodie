Transfer peanut butter to a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until softened, 15 to 20 seconds.    
Spoon peanut butter into a piping bag and gently fill each corn snack with peanut butter.    
Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.    
Dip the filled corn snacks into the melted white chocolate until evenly coated; transfer to a sheet of waxed paper to cool.
