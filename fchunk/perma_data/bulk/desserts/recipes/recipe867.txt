Place pineapple in a large resealable plastic bag. Add honey, butter, hot pepper sauce, and salt. Seal bag, and shake to coat evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight.    
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.    
Grill pineapple for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until heated through and grill marks appear.
