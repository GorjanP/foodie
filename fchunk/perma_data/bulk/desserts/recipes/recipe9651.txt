Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9 inch baking pan.    
Melt chocolate in the microwave or in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir frequently until smooth. Remove from heat, and let cool.    
Cream together the shortening and sugar until smooth.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, stirring constantly until well blended. In a separate bowl, mix together  applesauce, melted chocolate and vanilla.  Add to the egg mixture, stirring until smooth.    
Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt; gradually stir into the batter. Fold in chopped walnuts. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of cake comes out clean.  Let cool in pan before cutting.
