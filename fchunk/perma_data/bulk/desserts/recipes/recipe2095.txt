Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and the sugar.  Slowly add the flour and salt, mixing well.  Roll out dough with a rolling pin until it is 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. Place on cookie sheet and prick with a fork.    
Bake for 5 to 8 minutes, or until light brown at the edges.
