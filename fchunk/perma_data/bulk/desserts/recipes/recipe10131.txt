Combine apricots, water, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and butter and margarine in a large pot. Cook over medium low heat till apricots are thoroughly cooked.  You may need to adjust the water or sugar, depending on the tartness and the amount of cooking.  The apricots need to be very sweet and very juicy.    
Cut the tortillas into 1 inch strips.    
Add tortilla strips to the apricots a few at a time.  Cook about 20 minutes on very low heat.    
This cobbler can also be made in a 3 quart casserole dish, and baked in the oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes.
