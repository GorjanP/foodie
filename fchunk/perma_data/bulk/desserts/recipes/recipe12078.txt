Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish.    
Spread waffle pieces in the bottom of the baking dish.    
Beat milk, eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well-blended. Pour over waffles in the baking dish, making sure to cover them evenly. Let stand for 5 minutes.    
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and edges start to brown and pull away from the sides, 20 to 25 minutes.
