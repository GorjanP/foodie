Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Grease a 9x13-inch sheet pan.    
Mash vegetable shortening and sugar together in a large bowl until smooth and creamy; beat in eggs until fully incorporated.    
Stir buttermilk, cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla extract into the shortening mixture until the liquid ingredients are an even color and texture.    
Sift flour into the liquid ingredients until combined.    
Pour half the batter into a separate bowl.    
Lightly stir red food color into one bowl of batter and green food color into the other bowl of batter.    
Quickly fold 3/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoon white vinegar into the bowl of red batter; quickly fold 3/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoon white vinegar into the bowl of green batter.    
Pour the red and green batters into the prepared sheet pan in alternating colors.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely before frosting.
