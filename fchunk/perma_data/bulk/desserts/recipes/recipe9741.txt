Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Cut fruit into small pieces.  In a large bowl, dredge fruit and nuts in 1 cup flour.    
Cream together butter, brown sugar, and egg yolks. Stir together 2 cups flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg; add to the creamed mixture. In a small bowl, dissolve baking soda into sweetened condensed milk. Gradually add soda mixture and brandy to the dough. Turn mixture into the big bowl of fruit and nuts. Combine.    
Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold into the dough.    
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned but still soft, about 20 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
