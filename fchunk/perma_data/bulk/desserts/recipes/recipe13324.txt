Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine cassava flour, potato starch, and stevia powder in a bowl; add coconut milk, coconut oil, egg yolks, orange liqueur, and honey and knead until dough is well mixed.    
Roll dough on a work surface using a rolling pin until 1/4-inch thick. Cut egg-shaped cookies using an egg-shaped cookie cutter. Place egg-shaped cookies on a baking sheet. Spread jam over each cookie and top with sprinkles.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to become lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Cool completely.
