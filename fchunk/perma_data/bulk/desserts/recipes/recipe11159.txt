Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly brown the bread in the butter. Stir apples, sugar, and raisins into pan, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until a light crust forms on the underside, about 10 minutes. Flip the roesti onto a serving plate, cut into wedges, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before serving.
