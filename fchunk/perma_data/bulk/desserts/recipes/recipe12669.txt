Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press the pie crust into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate.    
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs lightly. Stir in the sugar, butter, walnuts, coconut, and raisins. Pour into the pie shell.    
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center of the pie comes out clean.
