Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 18 muffin cups.    
Beat 3/4 cup brown sugar, white sugar, and 1/2 cup butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs; beat until incorporated. Beat in pumpkin puree and water.    
Mix 1 3/4 cup flour, baking soda, salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.    
Combine 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl using two forks until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle streusel onto each muffin.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
