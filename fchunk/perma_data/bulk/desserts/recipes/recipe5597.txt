Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup margarine, oil, 4 tablespoons cocoa and water.  Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring often.  Set aside.    
In a large bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. Make a well in the center, and pour in the cocoa mixture.  Stir until smooth.  Mix in the buttermilk, 2 teaspoons vanilla, cinnamon, baking soda and eggs.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool slightly before frosting.
