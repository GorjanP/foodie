Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Whip butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add agave syrup, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract; mix until smooth. Stir in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons oat flour, chocolate chips, baking powder, and salt until dough is thoroughly combined. Scoop dough by teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 9 minutes.
