Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.    
Blend the egg and the almond flavoring into the creamed butter and sugar.    
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.    
Blend the flour mixture into the butter mixture.    
Fold the pineapple tidbits and coconut flakes into the dough.    
Drop teaspoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
