Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10 inch Bundt pan. Place the ground nuts in pan and roll the pan around to coat the inside with nuts.    
In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in eggs, oil, coffee liqueur and water. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Pour batter into prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Pour sauce over the cake while still in the pan. Let stand 30 minutes before removing from pan.    
To make the sauce:  In a saucepan, combine sugar, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup coffee liqueur and margarine. Bring to a boil, then continue to boil for 2 minutes.
