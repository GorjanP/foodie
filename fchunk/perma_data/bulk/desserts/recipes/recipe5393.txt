Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds on a baking sheet.    
Toast almonds in the preheated oven until lightly browned and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow almonds to cool.    
Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.    
Lightly beat eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a bowl. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in another bowl. Gradually beat egg mixture into flour mixture with an electric mixer until dough comes together. Add toasted almonds and mix until just incorporated.    
Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and shape dough into a 3x14-inch log. Transfer log to prepared baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until firm to the touch, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow log to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Transfer log to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices, using a serrated knife. Return biscotti slices to baking sheet, cut-side up.    
Return biscotti to the oven and bake until biscotti are firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Flip each cookie and continue baking until toasted, about 20 minutes more. Cool biscotti completely before storing in an airtight container.
