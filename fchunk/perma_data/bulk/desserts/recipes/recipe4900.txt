Mix oatmeal and coconut together in a large bowl.    
Put other ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. When mixture comes to a boil, let it boil for 2 minutes.(any longer your cookies will be crumbly, any shorter, your cookies will be gooey)    
Remove from heat and pour over the oatmeal-coconut mixture. Working quickly now, mix well and drop by spoon onto waxed paper. Let sit until firm and cool. Excellent for freezing.
