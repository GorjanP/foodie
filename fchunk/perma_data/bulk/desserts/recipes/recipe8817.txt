Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Combine flour, hazelnuts, and baking powder.    
In a large bowl, beat butter and honey until smooth.  Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.    
Divide dough in half.  On prepared baking sheet, form each half into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide, spacing about 2 inches apart.    
Bake for 14 to 16 minutes until golden brown.  Transfer logs to a cutting board and cut on diagonal into 1/2 inch thick slices.  Lay slices on ungreased baking sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes longer -- until dry.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.  Store in a tightly sealed container and let them age for a few days before serving.
