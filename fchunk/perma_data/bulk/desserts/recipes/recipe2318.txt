Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.    
In a large bowl, stir together the molasses, brown sugar, vinegar, and egg. Sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger and salt; add to molasses mixture.  Mix until  well blended. Spoon the dough by teaspoonfuls onto cookie  sheets, about 2 inches apart.    
Bake until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes.  Let cool on pans for 5 minutes before removing.
