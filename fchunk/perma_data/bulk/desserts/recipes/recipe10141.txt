Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and margarine. Stir in the molasses, vanilla and egg yolk. Add flour, mix until combined. Press dough into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.    
In a 2 quart saucepan, combine raisins, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Melt over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Spread evenly over the baked crust, and refrigerate until set, about 1 to 2 hours. Cut into 1x2 inch bars and serve.
