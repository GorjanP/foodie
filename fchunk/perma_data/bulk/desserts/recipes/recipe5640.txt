Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    
In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening and sugar.  Blend in peanut butter, salt, egg, vanilla and flour.  Mix well.    
Shape dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter.  Press your thumb into the center of each ball, creating a 1/2 inch depression.    
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes and cool on a rack.  Fill the centers with a tart jelly/fruit preserve.
