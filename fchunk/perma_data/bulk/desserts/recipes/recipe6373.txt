Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).    
Bake pie crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.    
Remove crust from oven and turn oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a bowl until smoothly combined.    
Pour filling into crust.    
Bake until filling is set, about 30 minutes.    
Remove from oven and let cool completely.    
Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and strawberry gelatin in a saucepan until smooth; place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring constantly, until the gelatin has dissolved and the glaze has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.    
Arrange the sliced strawberries atop the cheese filling.    
Pour warm glaze over sliced strawberries. Chill thoroughly in refrigerator before serving.
