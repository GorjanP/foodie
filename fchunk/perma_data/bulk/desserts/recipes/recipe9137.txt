Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Combine butterscotch-flavored chips, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon together in a bowl.    
Spread apples into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with chip mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.    
Mix 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender or your fingers until mixture is crumbly; stir in pecans and oats. Sprinkle topping over apples.    
Bake in the oven until apples are tender, 25 to 35 minutes.
