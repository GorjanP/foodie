Use a pastry chopper (or food processor) to break up the almond paste into a granulated form.  Put in mixing bowl and gradually add the sugar.    
In another small bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Fold the egg whites into the sugar/almond paste mixture gently.    
On a greased and floured cookie sheet, drop a spoonful of the mixture.  Press pine nuts into the top of the cookie (you want to cover the top with nuts).    
Bake at 325 degrees F (170 degrees C) for 10-12 minutes.  Cool on wire rack.
