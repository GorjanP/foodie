In a large bowl, blend butter and sugar until creamy.  Add egg and beat well.    
In another bowl, stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt; gradually add to butter mixture.  Add vanilla and blend thoroughly. Stir in the optional raisins.    
Form dough into ball, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 1 hour.    
Roll out dough on well-floured board to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters (2 1/2 inches in diameter) and place 1 inch apart on lightly greased cookie sheet.    
Bake in 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 10-12 minutes or until edges are golden.  Store in airtight container.
