Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.    
Roll dough out onto a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut dough with a round or Linzer cookie cutter. Use a smaller cutter to cut the center from the tops. Place cookie bottoms and tops 1-inch apart on prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Spread a small amount of the cranberry mixture onto one side of the bottom half of a cookie. Place the top half of the cookie on top of the cranberry mixture. Repeat assembly process with remaining cookies and cranberry filling.
