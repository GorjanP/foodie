Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the moisture is absorbed completely, 15 to 20 minutes.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.    
Mix cooked quinoa, coconut, oats, flour, brown sugar, mashed bananas, applesauce, peanut butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Fold chocolate chips into the quinoa mixture; drop by spoonful onto prepared baking sheets.    
Bake in preheated oven until browned around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cookies to set up a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack
