Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.    
Place chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Stir frequently to avoid lumps, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and wipe away the water from the bottom of the bowl.    
Gradually whisk sugar into the chocolate-butter mixture. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking until combined. Fold flour and cocoa powder into the batter. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to pull way from the pan and top is dry, 30 to 40 minutes.    
Whisk confectioners' sugar, butter, cocoa powder, and honey together in a bowl. Add milk gradually, stirring until icing reaches desired consistency. Spread over brownies while still warm.
