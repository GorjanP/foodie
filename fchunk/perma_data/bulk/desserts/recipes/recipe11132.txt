Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets and outside of 4 inverted 6-ounce custard cups.    
Whisk together the flour and almonds in a bowl; set aside.    
Bring the sugar, butter, and corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir the flour mixture into the saucepan. Add the almond extract and continue stirring until incorporated. Measuring the batter by tablespoons, drop four cookies onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread each tablespoon of batter into a 4-inch circle.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of the cookies are golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and allow to cool for 1 minute. Use a spatula to remove the cookies from the baking sheet; place each cookie onto an inverted custard cup. Allow the cookies to cool while continuing to bake the remaining batter in batches.
