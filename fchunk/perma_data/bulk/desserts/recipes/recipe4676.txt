Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 13x9 inch baking pan. Combine 1/2 cup of the white sugar with the ground cinnamon and the ground nutmeg; set aside.    
Measure sifted flour, add baking powder, salt, and 3 tablespoons sugar, and sift again.  Cut shortening into sifted ingredients until mixture looks like coarse meal.  Add milk, mixing until a soft dough is formed.    
Knead dough on lightly floured board half a minute.  Divide dough in half.  Roll each half to a 1/8 inch thickness. Cut eight 5 inch squares out of the dough.  Place an apple half on each square.  Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of the sugar-spice mixture.  Moisten edges of dough and bring corners up over apples, pressing edges together. Place covered apples in the prepared baking pan with joined edges either on top or underneath the apples.    
Mix together brown sugar, butter, salt, and water; bring to a boil.  Pour over dumplings in pan.    
Bake at 375  degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until apples are tender.  Serve warm.  Makes 8 servings.  The brown sugar mixture forms a delicious butterscotch sauce around the dumplings.
