Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    
Cream together butter and the brown and white sugars in a bowl until smooth. Beat in the eggs, vanilla and orange extract.    
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice; stir flour mixture into the sugar mixture. Add the rolled oats, walnuts and cranberries and mix thoroughly. Using a small ice cream scoop or teaspoon, drop rounded scoops of dough onto the prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
