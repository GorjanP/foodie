Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Combine oats, flour, salt, and baking soda; stir into butter mixture one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in dried cranberries and white chocolate. Drop by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in preheated oven, or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
