Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch Bundt pan.    
Toss together the shredded apple, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a bowl until evenly coated. Set aside.    
Whisk together the eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until the mixture is fluffy. Stir in the olive oil, orange juice, flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon to make a batter. Fold the apple mixture into the batter. Pour mixture into the prepared bundt pan.    
Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before turning out of the pan onto a wire rack to cool completely.
