In a double boiler, whisk together the brown sugar, flour, and cornstarch.  Add just enough milk to make a paste.  Mix in beaten egg yolks, and then add the remainder of the milk.  Cook slowly, stirring constantly; when thick, remove from heat.  Add butter or margarine and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Pour the filling into the baked pie shell.    
In medium mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff.  Beat in cream of tarter,  white sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Spread meringue over pie filling.    
Bake at 375 degree F (190 degrees C) until meringue peaks turn a golden brown.
