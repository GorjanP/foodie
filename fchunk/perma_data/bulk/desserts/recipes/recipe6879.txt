Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Spread toasted bread into the bottom the baking dish.    
Heat milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat until bubbles form around the sides. Remove from heat, add butter, and stir until butter melts. Pour milk mixture over the bread into the prepared baking dish. Stir until all bread is touching milk mixture; let stand 15 minutes.    
Stir rhubarb, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; pour rhubarb mixture into bread mixture and stir. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the rhubarb mixture.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 45 to 50 minutes.
