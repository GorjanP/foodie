Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9-inch baking pan.    
Beat 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Blend in egg and vanilla extract until combined. Add milk and beat well.    
Sift cake flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into the sugar-butter mixture. Fold in strawberries. Spread batter into the prepared pan.    
Beat brown sugar and butter together in another bowl until creamy. Blend in flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Sprinkle topping over the batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
