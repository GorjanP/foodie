Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, stir together the apples and pumpkin butter. Spread evenly in a 8 or 9 inch square baking dish. Pour the pumpkin bread mix into a bowl, and cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over the top of the apples.    
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the apples are tender enough to insert a fork. Serve warm with whipped cream.
