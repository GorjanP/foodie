Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and mashed bananas.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan and sprinkle with topping.    
To make topping: in a small bowl, mix together chocolate chips, chopped peanuts and brown sugar.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
