Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).    
To make crust:  Mix together the butter, 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/4 cup sugar with a fork until crumbly.  Press into an 8 inch square pan and bake for 20 minutes.  Crust will look white.  Do not brown!    
Combine the eggs, 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, baking powder and lemon juice in a blender. Blend until well mixed.  Pour over pre-baked crust.    
Return to oven and bake an additional 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Let bars cool before cutting.
