Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
Mix cracker crumbs with melted butter in a bowl and press mixture into a 9-inch pie dish to make a crust.    
Bake crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 minutes; let cool.    
Beat cream cheese with 2 tablespoons milk and white sugar in a bowl, using an electric mixer, until creamy and smooth. Spread cream cheese mixture into pie crust. Arrange strawberry halves over cream cheese mixture.    
Whip both amounts of cream with an electric mixer in a bowl until the cream is fluffy and holds firm peaks, about 3 minutes. Whisk French vanilla pudding mix with 1 1/2 cups milk in a separate bowl until pudding begins to thicken, 2 minutes. Let pudding stand 3 more minutes to set. Gently fold whipped cream into pudding mix and spread pudding mixture atop strawberries. Let pie chill for 2 hours before serving.
