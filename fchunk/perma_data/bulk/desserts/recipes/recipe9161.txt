Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.    
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 12 to 17 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the tin for 5 minutes.    
Stir strawberry jam in a bowl until it reaches a smooth and spreadable texture. Spread a thin layer of jam onto each cupcake. Refrigerate cupcakes until jam has set into the cake, 3 hours to overnight.    
Mix strawberries, white sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until evenly combined; refrigerate until strawberries are slightly broken down, at least 3 hours.    
Beat cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form and whipped cream is light and fluffy.    
Top each cupcake with 3 or 4 slices strawberry and about 2 tablespoons whipped cream.
