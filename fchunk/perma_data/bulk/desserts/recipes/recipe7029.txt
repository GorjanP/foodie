Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.    
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder and salt; stir into the wet mixture until just blended. Finally, fold in the pecans and coconut. Dough may be a little dry. Shape dough into walnut sized mounds and place 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet.    
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Cool on baking sheets.
