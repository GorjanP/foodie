Stir strawberries with glaze in a bowl and place in refrigerator to chill. Stir cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.    
Beat cream in a separate bowl with an electric mixer just until it begins to thicken; add cream cheese mixture and continue beating until thick. Pour cream mixture into baked pie crust; top with strawberry mixture. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
