Combine almond milk and cinnamon sticks in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes. Cover, remove from heat, and add coconut oil. Allow to steep and cool for 30 minutes.    
Remove lid and strain out cinnamon sticks. Whisk in coconut milk, honey, rum, and vanilla extract. Chill for 1 hour.    
Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately for 'ice milk' consistency or freeze overnight until firm.
