Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.    
In a medium sized bowl mix the shortening, applesauce, white sugar, brown sugar, egg and vanilla. Beat until well combined.    
In another bowl combine the infant cereal, flour, baking soda, salt and wheat germ. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix well.    
Spoon tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes or until just set. Let cool on wire racks before storing.
