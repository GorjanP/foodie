In a medium bowl beat butter on high for 30 seconds; add sugar and beat well.  Stir in flour and beat well.  Stir in almonds and lemon zest.  Divide dough into thirds and chill, covered, for 1 hour.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut with 2 1/2 inch cookie cutter.  Place cookies 1 inch apart on a cookie sheet.    
In a small bowl beat egg and water together; brush over cookies.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.    
In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.  Dip half of each cookie into melted chocolate; place on wax paper to cool.
