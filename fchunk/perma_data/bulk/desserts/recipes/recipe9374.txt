Cream butter and sugar; add water.  Mix flour, baking powder and salt; fold into creamed mixture.  Mix well; stir in vanilla.   Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into batter.    
Spread batter evenly in a greased and floured lamb mold (cast iron if you have one or tin).   Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes.
