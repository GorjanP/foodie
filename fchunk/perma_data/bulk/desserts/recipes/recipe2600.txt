Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place mini muffin liners into pans.    
In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, oil, and water. Add the brownie mix and stir until combined. Finally, stir in the instant coffee and cinnamon.    
Fill the muffin liners halfway to the top. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Test for doneness with a toothpick. When the bon-bons are completely cool, dust with confectioners' sugar.
