In a medium bowl, combine fruit with fruit juice and spices. Cover, and allow to stand overnight.    
The next day mix together soaked fruits, almonds, cream, and ice cream.  Pour mixture into a large mold, and cover with foil.  Freeze for at least one week to allow flavour to develop.    
Unmold by quickly dipping into hot water, and inverting onto serving plate.
