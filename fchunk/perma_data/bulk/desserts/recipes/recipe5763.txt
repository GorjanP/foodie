Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In large bowl, with mixer at medium speed, combine 1 cup flour and the next six ingredients until well mixed.    
In small bowl, mix 3 tablespoons of flour and the remaining ingredients until well mixed (mixture will be crumbly).    
Drop chocolate dough by teaspoonfuls, 1 inch apart, onto cookie sheet.  Top each with 1/2 teaspoon of peanut-butter dough.  Dip a fork into flour and press gently across top of each cookie.    
Bake 12 minutes or until firm.  Move cookies to racks; cool.
