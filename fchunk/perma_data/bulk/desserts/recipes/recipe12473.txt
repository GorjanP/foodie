Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.    
Bake in the preheated oven until almonds start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes.    
Melt candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Add almond extract quickly and stir in the toasted almonds.    
Pour almond mixture onto a baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Break into pieces.
