Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
In a bowl, stir together the flour, 1 cup of sugar, baking powder, milk, and vegetable oil to make a smooth batter; scrape batter into the prepared baking dish.    
In a separate bowl, stir the cherries with 1 cup of sugar and the almond extract; spoon the cherry mixture over the batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
