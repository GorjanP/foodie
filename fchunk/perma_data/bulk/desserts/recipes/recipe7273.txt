Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish.    
Toss pears with lemon juice in a bowl. Combine 1/2 cup light brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Add sugar mixture to pear mixture; toss to coat. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle pear mixture with Cheddar cheese.    
Combine flour and 1/2 cup light brown sugar in a food processor; pulse to mix. Cut butter into flour mixture until crumb consistency. Sprinkle topping over Cheddar cheese layer.    
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
