Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.    
Combine butter, 1 1/2 cups flour, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a mixing bowl; beat until combined with an electric mixer. Press mixture into bottom of prepared baking dish.    
Bake crust in preheated oven until firm, about 15 minutes. Remove and let crust cool.    
In large mixing bowl, combine 6 egg yolks, remaining 1/4 cup flour, evaporated milk, 2 cups sugar, and rhubarb. Stir together and pour over cooled crust.    
Bake pie in oven until filling is set, about 1 hour.    
For meringue, beat 6 egg whites in a large bowl using an electric mixer until whites are foamy. Beat in 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla extract until the mixture holds stiff peaks. Spread meringue over rhubarb filling.    
Return pie to oven and bake until meringue is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
