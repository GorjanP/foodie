Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Generously grease and flour a 9-inch pie plate.    
In a medium bowl, mix together sugar, flour, and salt. Stir in melted butter and vanilla extract. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in evaporated milk followed by coconut. Pour mixture into pie plate.    
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until custard is nearly set and a knife inserted near the center of the pie comes out clean. Let cool, then refrigerate before serving.
