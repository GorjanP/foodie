Whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, vanilla, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and gently cook until the mixture thickens, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, about 30 minutes. Pour into a heatproof serving dish and set aside.    
Whip the egg whites with confectioners' sugar to stiff peaks (see Editor's Note). Spread meringue on top of milk mixture. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. Sprinkle with cinnamon before serving, if desired.
