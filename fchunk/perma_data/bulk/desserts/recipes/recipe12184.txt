Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Mix graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar, butter, and cocoa powder together in a bowl; divide between 12 muffin cups and press into the bottoms to form an even crust in each.    
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Move to a cooling rack to cool completely.    
Scoop enough ice cream atop the cooled crusts to fill the muffin cups 3/4-full. Top each with whipped topping to fill completely.    
Put muffin cups in the freezer until the ice cream and whipped topping are firm, about 4 hours.    
When ready to serve, dip each muffin cup into a bowl of warm water for about 5 seconds and turn onto a plate.
