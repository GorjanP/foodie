Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 standard muffin cups with papers.    
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl.    
Beat white sugar, butter, and orange zest together in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes; beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.    
Stir cream, orange juice, and vanilla extract together in a cup.    
Beat flour mixture into butter mixture on low speed in 3 batches, alternating with cream mixture and ending with flour mixture, just until fully combined. Fill prepared muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
