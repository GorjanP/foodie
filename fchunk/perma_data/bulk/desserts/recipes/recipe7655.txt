Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with butter.    
Combine flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, baking powder, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and allspice in a bowl. Beat pumpkin puree, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in another bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.    
Stir 3/4 cups brown sugar, butter, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl until just combined. Sprinkle over cake batter.    
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
