Pour the whipping cream and Amarula liqueur into a fondue pot; cook and stir over medium-low heat until the mixture boils. Continue to stir while adding the chocolate chips. Reduce heat to low, and stir until the chocolate melts and blends completely with the cream mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Take care not to overheat the mixture. To serve, reduce heat to lowest setting.
