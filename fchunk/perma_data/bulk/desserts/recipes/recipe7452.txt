Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x12 inch pan with aluminum foil, going up the sides.    
Sift the rice flour, brown sugar, white sugar, and baking soda into a large bowl.  Make a well in the center and pour in the coconut milk, milk, and vanilla extract.  Stir together until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and sprinkle  sesame seeds over the top.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes.  Let cool in pan for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and place on a cutting board top side up.  Cut into 1 inch squares.
