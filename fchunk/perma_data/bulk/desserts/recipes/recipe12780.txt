Whisk confectioners' sweetener, cocoa powder, glucomannon, and salt together in a large microwave-safe bowl or measuring cup; pudding will bubble up during cooking.    
Combine cream, water, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Whisk gradually into the cocoa mixture until no dry spots remain. Add chocolate pieces.    
Microwave the pudding on high for 1 minute. Whisk briskly and continue cooking, whisking every 40 seconds, until bubbling and chocolate is melted, about 3 minutes. Pour into seven 4-ounce ramekins or serving dishes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 30 minutes.
