Preheat oven 350 degrees F (150 degrees C).    
Mix the flour, sugar, salt, and nuts together in a medium bowl. Stir in the vanilla. Either with your hands (my favorite way) or with a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture until it becomes a ball. Shape the dough into 24 one inch flat circles, and place on a cookie sheet.    
Bake for 30 minutes or until they are lightly browned. After they have cooled on a rack, dust them heavily with confectioners' sugar.
