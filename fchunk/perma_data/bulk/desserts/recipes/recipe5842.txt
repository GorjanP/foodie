Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).    
Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the sour cream, vanilla, and lemon peel. Beat for an additional 2 minutes. Batter will look curdled. Combine flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Pour the flour mixture into the egg mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter into a prepared 8x4 inch loaf pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a plate.    
To make glaze:  Whisk together the lemon juice and powdered sugar. Pour glaze over entire cake and allow cake to cool while the glaze is soaked in.
