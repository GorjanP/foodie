Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Pour crushed graham crackers into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix butter and sugar into the graham crackers using your hands until crumbs are moist; press into the dish forming a crust.    
Arrange marshmallows in the crust, leaving space between each marshmallow.    
Whisk milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until pudding thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour pudding over marshmallows. Arrange banana slices and vanilla wafer cookies atop the pudding.    
Bake in the preheated oven until marshmallows melt, 20 to 30 minutes. Drizzle with chocolate syrup.
