Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 - 9 inch round pans. Sift together the flour and baking powder. Set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and red food color.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the cherry juice. Stir in the cherries. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
