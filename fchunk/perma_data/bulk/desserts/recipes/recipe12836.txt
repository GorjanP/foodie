Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).    
Place raisins, candied cherries, dates, and candied pineapple in a bowl; stir in 1/2 cup bourbon whiskey; set aside to soak.    
Beat butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture; beat in vanilla extract and cinnamon with last egg.    
Stir pecans and fruit mixture into butter mixture; stir in self-rising flour alternately with remaining bourbon whiskey as needed to form a soft dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.    
Bake in the preheated oven just until cookies begin to look dry, about 30 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack; store in a sealed container lined with waxed paper.
