Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a cookie sheet.    
Beat egg whites until fluffy.  Add salt and cream of tartar. Adding sugar gradually, continue to beat until egg whites are stiff and will stand.  Fold in desired food coloring, peppermint extract and chocolate chips.    
Drop by teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet, put in oven and turn oven OFF.  Leave in oven undisturbed several hours or overnight.  Do not open oven once cookies have been put in or they will be soggy, not crisp and airy.  NO PEEK!
