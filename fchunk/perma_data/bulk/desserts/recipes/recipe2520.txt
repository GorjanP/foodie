Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Line a 15 x 10 inch baking pan with foil and grease it well.   Line the pan with soda crackers.    
 In a medium saucepan, melt the butter.  Add the brown sugar and cook stirring it until it dissolves.  Bring to a boil and cook about 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Immediately pour mixture over the soda crackers.    
Bake for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture starts to bubble.  Spread the chocolate chips over the hot cookies.  Let set for a minute.  Spread the chocolate evenly.  Sprinkle with nuts.  Let cool, then cut into bars.
