Line one 9x13 inch pan with foil and spray with a non-stick cooking spray.    
Boil sugar, syrup, and peanut butter in saucepan for a minute.  Not more or the bars will be impossible to eat.  Add the grape nuts and stir.  Immediately spread into the prepared pan. Let cool and cut into bars.  Great snacks!
