Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Then mix in the corn flakes cereal, rolled oats, coconut, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.    
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
