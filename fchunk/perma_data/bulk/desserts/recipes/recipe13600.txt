Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7-inch baking pan and line with parchment paper.    
Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.    
Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale. Stir in melted chocolate and olive oil with a spatula until well combined. Combine almonds, flour, and cinnamon in a second bowl and add to chocolate mixture. Stir until well combined. Pour into the prepared baking pan.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely before slicing and serving.
