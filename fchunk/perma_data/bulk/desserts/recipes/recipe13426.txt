Mash 1 1/2 cups huckleberries with sugar in pot. Stir in water, cornstarch, lemon juice; cook on medium heat until sauce is thickened and semi-clear, about 10 minutes.    
Place the remaining 2 1/2 cups huckleberries in pie crust. Pour sauce on top, stirring lightly to ensure thorough coating. Refrigerate until set, 2 to 4 hours.    
Spread whipped topping over pie and serve.
