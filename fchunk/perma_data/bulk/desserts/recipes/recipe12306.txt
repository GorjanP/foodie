Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.    
Mix sugar, matzo meal, oil, eggs, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, walnuts, and salt together in a bowl; pour into prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out mostly clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
