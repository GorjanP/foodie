Bring a large pot of water to boil.    
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, currants, raisins, suet, bread crumbs and sugar.  Mix egg and milk with mixed spice, baking powder, salt and molasses.  Stir into flour mixture to form a wet dough.    
Dip a heavy cotton cloth in boiling water and then sprinkle it with flour.  Place dough in center of cloth, draw opposite corners together to form a ball, leaving a bit of room for the dumpling to expand, and tie tightly with twine to seal.    
Place the dumpling in the boiling water, reduce heat to a low boil, and cook 3 1/2 hours, topping water off as needed.  Remove the dumpling from the water, remove the cloth and dry the dumpling in front of a fire or in a 150 degree oven until surface is no longer wet.  Serve.
