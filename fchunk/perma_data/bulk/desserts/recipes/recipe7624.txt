Combine gelatin and cold coffee in a small bowl; set aside for 5 minutes to soften. In a heat-proof bowl or the top of a double boiler, combine coffee mixture, milk, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and the egg yolks. Set the bowl over a pan of over simmering water. Stir until sugar is dissolved and gelatin has melted.    
Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and the egg yolks. Cook and stir until mixture is thick and creamy and coats the back of a metal spoon. Remove from heat.    
Whip the egg whites (with a pinch of salt, if desired) until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites and vanilla into slightly cooled custard. Pour into a serving dish or lightly greased mold and chill until set, at least 4 hours.
