Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 9x5 inch loaf pans, line them with parchment paper, and grease the paper.    
Beat eggs, salt and vanilla together until very light and lemon colored. Add sugar, 1 cup of the flour and 2 teaspoons baking powder. Put brazil nuts, walnuts, pecans, red and green cherries into a large bowl. Dust with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Then add the egg and sugar mixture. This is a very stiff mixture. Mix with hands.    
Press into 3 - 9x5 inch loaf pans which you have lined with parchment paper and have greased both pan and paper. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
