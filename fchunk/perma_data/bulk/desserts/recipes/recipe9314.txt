Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Beat cream cheese, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth.    
Cut 3-inch circles out of each tortilla using a round cookie cutter. Fold tortilla rounds into a taco-shell shape.    
Hold folded tortilla with tongs and cook in the preheated oil until the taco shape holds and tortilla is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cooked tortilla to a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining tortilla rounds.    
Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over cooked tortilla rounds. Spread cream cheese mixture into each shell; top with grapes and strawberries.
