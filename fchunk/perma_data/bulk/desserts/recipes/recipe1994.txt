Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C.) Lightly butter 2 baking sheets, or line with parchment paper.    
Cream the butter, sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Sift together the flour and salt; mix into the butter mixture. Stir in the pecans. Dust your hands with a little of the confectioners' sugar and roll the dough into 1 inch balls.    
Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets and bake for 25 minutes or just until brown.  Put on racks to cool for 15 minutes, then roll in the confectioners sugar.
