Place the chocolate in a glass or plastic bowl. Heat in the microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, or until almost melted. Stir until smooth.    
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Stuff each date with a pecan half and place onto the baking sheet. Drizzle the stuffed dates with melted chocolate, then sprinkle with coconut. Place into freezer, and freeze for 1 hour before serving.
