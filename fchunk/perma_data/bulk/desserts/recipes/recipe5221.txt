Insert craft sticks into apples.  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.    
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, pour candies and water.  Occasionally brushing down sides of pan with a heat-resistant pastry brush, heat candy to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.    
Dip apples in hot liquid and place on waxed paper to harden.
