Spread 1 tablespoon chocolate hazelnut spread onto the bottom of each peanut butter cookie.    
Skewer a marshmallow and turn slowly over a campfire or grill until roasted on the outside and soft and melted in the center, 2 to 3 minutes.    
Place roasted marshmallow on top of 1 cookie, chocolate-hazelnut spread-side up; cover with another cookie, chocolate-hazelnut spread-side down. Press together to grasp the marshmallow and pull out the skewer.
