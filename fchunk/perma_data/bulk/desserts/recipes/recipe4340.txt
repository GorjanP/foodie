In large mixing bowl, cream together sugars and shortening till fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Stir into creamed mixture.    
Stir in the oats, and the orange candy.  NOTE: Dip a pair of kitchen shears into a glass of hot water or spray with a non-stick spray to make snipping the orange slices easier.   Using about one tablespoon of mixture for each cookie, roll into one inch balls.  Place on greased cookie sheets.    
Bake in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove and cool on a wire rack.
