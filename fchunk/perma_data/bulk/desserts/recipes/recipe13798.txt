Cut cores out of apples, leaving bottoms of apples intact. Cut off and save tops of cores. Use a spoon or sharp knife to clean flesh from the cored area of the apple, leaving hollows.    
Place 1 teaspoon cinnamon candies, 1 teaspoon butter, and 1 tablespoon brown sugar into the hollow of each apple. Place retained top of core into hollow of each apple. Wrap apples in aluminum foil.    
Place wrapped apples into the coals of a campfire and cook until apples are soft and filling has melted, about 15 minutes.
