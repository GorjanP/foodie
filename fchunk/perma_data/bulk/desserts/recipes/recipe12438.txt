Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan. Add white sugar and brown sugar and stir until dissolved. Add pureed mangoes and continue to stir.    
Combine cornstarch with 1 cup sugar-milk mixture in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Pour mixture back into the pot. Cook and stir over low heat until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes.    
Transfer pudding to a serving bowl and cover closely with plastic wrap to no skin forms on top. Sprinkle with coconut. Let cool completely in the refrigerator before serving.
