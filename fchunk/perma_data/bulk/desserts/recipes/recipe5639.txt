Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In a small saucepan over low heat, mix dates, sugar and 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 15 minutes, or until thick and smooth. Set aside to cool.    
Cream butter and brown sugar together until smooth.  Gradually mix in flour, baking soda, and salt.  Add the oatmeal and mix well. Stir in 2 to 4 tablespoons of water.  Form the dough into a ball and refrigerate for 15 minutes.    
On a floured surface, roll dough to 1/8 inch thickness and cut into 2 inch rounds. Place 1/2 of the rounds on cookie sheets.  Spoon date mixture in the center of each round and top with another round.  Press edges firmly together.    
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until browned.
