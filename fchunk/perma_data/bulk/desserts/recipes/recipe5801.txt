Combine flour, ginger and salt and set aside.    
In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar.  Beat in the molasses.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.  Cover and chill for four hours.    
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets.    
On floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Using a 1-3/4 inch cutter, cut into rounds and place 1 inch apart on cookie sheets.    
Bake for 10-12 minutes until lightly colored and firm to the touch.  Cool cookies on wire racks.
