Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9 inch square baking pan with cooking spray. In a food processor, grind 1/2 cup shredded coconut into a fine powder.    
In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Mix in egg, corn syrup, apple juice concentrate, and vanilla. Mix in coconut powder, whole wheat flour, gluten, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup shredded coconut, flax seed, raisins, and soy nuts. Press evenly into the prepared pan.
