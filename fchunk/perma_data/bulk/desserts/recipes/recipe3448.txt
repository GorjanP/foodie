In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt chocolate chips with EAGLE BRAND(R) and vanilla, stirring frequently.    
Remove from heat.  Add peanut butter chips; stir just to distribute chips throughout mixture.    
Spread evenly into wax paper lined 8- or 9-inch square pan.  Chill 2 hours or until firm.  Turn fudge onto cutting board; peel off paper and cut into squares.  Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
