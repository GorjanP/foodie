In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Combine the hot water and instant coffee, then add to the dry ingredients along with the oil, vinegar, vanilla and eggs. Mix until smooth and well blended. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with the 1/4 cup of sugar.    
Bake for 45 to 60  minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
