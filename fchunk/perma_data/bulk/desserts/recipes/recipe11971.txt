Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Place bread cubes in the greased baking dish. Pour half-and-half on top.    
Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, raisins, pecans, butter, pumpkin pie spice, and orange zest together in a large bowl. Pour over the bread.    
Bake in the preheated oven until middle is set and edges are golden, 50 to 60 minutes.
