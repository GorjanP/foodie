Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.    
Reserve 1 cup of cake mix from the package.  In a bowl, combine remaining cake mix, 1 egg and melted margarine.  Press mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9x13 inch pan to form a crust.    
Mix together the pumpkin, 3 eggs, sugar, cinnamon and evaporated milk until blended.  Pour over the crust.  Combine the brown sugar and reserved 1 cup cake mix, then cut in the margarine until mixture is crumbly.  Sprinkle over the filling.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Keep refrigerated.
