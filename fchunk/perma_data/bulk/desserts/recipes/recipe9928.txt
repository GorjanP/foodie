Drain the pineapple juice and cherry water into a 2-cup measuring cup. Pour enough color to make 2 cups; discard the remaining soda. Pour the cola mixture into a saucepan.    
Bring the cola mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, then stir in the pineapple, cherries, cream cheese, and cherry gelatin until gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a mold or glass baking dish. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.
