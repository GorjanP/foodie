Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.    
Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting (see footnote for link to recipe).    
In a medium bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.  Stir in the egg yolk, then stir in the flour until combined.    
Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and dip in egg white. Place 1 inch apart on the cookie sheet. Make an indentation in each cookie with your finger or the end of a wooden spoon.    
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes; remove from oven and fill indentations with Cream Cheese Frosting. Return cookies to the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before removing from pan.
