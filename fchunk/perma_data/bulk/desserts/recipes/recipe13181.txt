Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake liners.    
Mix sugar, buttermilk, eggs, oil, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Stir in pineapple, carrots, and coconut.    
Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture gently into the carrot mixture. Fill lined muffin cups about 3/4-full of batter.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool, at least 25 minutes.    
Blend confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Frost the cooled cupcakes.
