Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper.    
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir sugar and salt with melted butter to dissolve completely. Remove saucepan from heat, add peanuts, and stir to coat completely; immediately pour onto prepared pan and spread into an even layer.    
Refrigerate until brittle, at least 30 minutes. Separate from parchment and break into pieces.
