In large bowl, beat cream cheese with electric mixer until creamy.  Add sugar, sour cream, eggs and vanilla and beat until smooth.  Pour cream cheese mixture over cookie crust.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until center is almost set.  Loosen cheesecake from sides of pan, cover loosely and chill in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.
