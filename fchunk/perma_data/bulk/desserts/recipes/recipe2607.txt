Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans.    
Combine flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium size bowl.    
In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine.  Add brown sugar, sugar, allspice and nutmeg; beat until light and fluffy.  Mix in eggs and vanilla extract.  Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture; mix well.  Add the sour cream; mix well.  Add another 1/3 of the dry ingredients; mix well.  Add half of the bananas; mix well.  Repeat with remaining 1/3  of the dry ingredients and remaining bananas. Pour batter into prepared pans.    
Bake until cake tests done, about 30 minutes.  Let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes, and then turn onto wire rack to cool.  Frost with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting.
