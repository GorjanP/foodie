Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly oil an 8-inch square baking pan.    
Combine flour, brown sugar, chopped walnuts, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, baking powder, and dates; mix well.    
Add eggs (see Cook's Note) and stir until dry ingredients are moistened.    
Spoon batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool slightly before cutting into bars or squares.
