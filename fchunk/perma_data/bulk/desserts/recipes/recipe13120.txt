Melt butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat; stir in brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Let cool for 5 minutes.    
Whisk milk into the saucepan until mixture is smooth.    
Beat 3 cups confectioners' sugar and salt into the butter mixture with an electric mixer on low speed. Add remaining confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time, beating until smooth.
