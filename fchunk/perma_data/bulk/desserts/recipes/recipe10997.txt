Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt cake pan.    
In a large bowl, stir together the cake mix and instant pudding. Add the eggs, oil, coffee flavored liqueur, and water, mix until  well blended. Pour into the prepared pan.    
Bake for 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.    
In a small saucepan, heat cream and instant coffee, until hot enough to dissolve coffee crystals. Pour into a bowl. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and coffee flavored liqueur. Pour over warm cake. Let cool before serving.
