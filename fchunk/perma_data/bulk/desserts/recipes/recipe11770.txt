Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.    
Melt butter and unsweetened chocolate together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove from heat and pour chocolate mixture into a bowl.    
Mix sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract into chocolate mixture using a fork. Stir flour and salt into chocolate mixture until batter is smooth; fold in chocolate chips, walnuts, and oats. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.    
Bake in the preheated oven until brownies are beginning to pull away from sides and middle is done, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool before cutting.
