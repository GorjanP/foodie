In a saucepan, combine chocolate, 1/2 cup milk, brown sugar, and egg yolks.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thick and smooth.  Cool.    
Stir together flour, soda, baking powder, and salt.    
In a large bowl, cream butter or margarine.  Blend in white sugar, beating until light and fluffy.  Mix together 3/4 cup milk and vanilla.  Stir flour mixture into creamed mixture alternately with flavored milk.  Make 3 dry and 2 liquid additions, combining lightly after each.  Stir in cooled chocolate custard.    
Beat egg whites to form stiff but moist peaks.  Fold into cake batter, and beat by hand for 1 minute.  Turn batter into two greased and floured 8 inch round cake pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.  Cool layers for 5 minutes, and then remove from pans.  Cool completely.
