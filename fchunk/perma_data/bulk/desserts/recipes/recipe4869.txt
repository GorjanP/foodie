Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).    
In a medium bowl, mix together the vegetable oil, sugar and eggs. Stir in yogurt and orange zest. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the mixture just until blended. Pour the dough into a greased 9x13 inch baking pan.    
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Poke holes in the cake with a knife, and pour the juice from the oranges over the cake slowly until it has all been absorbed.
