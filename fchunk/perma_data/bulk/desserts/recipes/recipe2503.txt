Preheat the over to 350 degrees. Reserve 3/4 cup of apple filling; set aside. Spoon the remaining filling into the crust. Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Add the eggs and mix well. Pour this over the LUCKY LEAF Apple Fruit Filling. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the center of the cake is set. Cool to room temperature.    
Mix the reserved LUCKY LEAF Apple Fruit Filling and caramel topping in a small saucepan and heat for about 1 minute, or until spreadable. Spoon the apple-caramel mixture over the top of the cheesecake and spread evenly. Decorate the edge of the cake with pecan halves and sprinkle with chopped pecans. Refrigerate the cake until ready to serve.
