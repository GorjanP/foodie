Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease six, 6 ounce, ovenproof custard cups.    
Cream together shortening, sugar and vanilla.  Beat in egg yolk.  Stir in raisins and nuts.  In a separate bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, baking powder and salt.  Add to batter alternately with milk, stirring until smooth.  Whip egg white until stiff.  Fold into batter.  Pour into prepared custard cups.    
Bake in preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, until set.
