Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Lightly grease cookie sheets.         
Mix together all of the ingredients, using just enough flour to make the dough so you can handle it, then mix in the rest of the flour just until not sticky.    
Roll out dough to approximately 1/8 inch thickness.  Cut out with cookie cutters and place on cookie sheets.  Bake for 10 minutes.
