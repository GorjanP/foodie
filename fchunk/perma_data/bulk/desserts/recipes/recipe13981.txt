Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Uncover, fluff with a fork, and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.    
Combine dates, oats, cranberries, and maple syrup in a food processor. Blend until a sticky paste forms.    
Mix 2 cups cooled quinoa, date mixture, and cinnamon together in a bowl.    
Line a small baking pan with parchment paper. Press mixture firmly into the pan. Cut into bars.
