Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 8 inch round cake layer pans.    
Dissolve the baking soda in the buttermilk.    
Combine the sugar, 3 1/2 cups of the flour, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, ground cinnamon and the butter. Stir in the buttermilk mixture.    
Toss the blackberries and raisins with the remaining 1/2 cup of flour to coat. Mix in the blackberries and the raisins into the batter and stir until evenly distributed. Pour batter into the prepared pans.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center of the cakes comes out clean.
