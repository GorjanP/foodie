Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 12-inch round springform pan.    
Combine olive oil, orange juice, and brandy in a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Combine flour, baking soda, and baking powder in another bowl and sift into the oil mixture. Fold in walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix well. Tip batter into the prepared springform pan and level the top. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes.
