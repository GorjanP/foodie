Pour the pineapple with juice and cinnamon candies into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin over the pineapple and stir until dissolved. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours until set. Fold in the whipped cream, marshmallows, and crushed mints. Pour into a tube pan or gelatin mold and freeze until nearly solid, about 1 hour.    
Unmold the gelatin and cut into 12 pieces. Serve partially frozen.
