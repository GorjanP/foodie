Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.    
Combine the sour cream, rum flavoring, orange extract, almond extract, lemon extract, vanilla extract and apricot brandy.  Set aside.  In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream and flavorings mixture, stirring just until incorporated.    
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
