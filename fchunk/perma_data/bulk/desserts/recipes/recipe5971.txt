Melt butter or margarine in a saucepan.  Add rind, lemon juice, and 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Beat eggs and egg yolks until thick, and add to lemon butter mixture.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until thick.  Chill.    
Beat 3 egg whites until stiff.  Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, and continue beating until stiff and glossy.  Fill baked tart shells with lemon custard, and top with meringue.    
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) just until tarts are a delicate brown color.
