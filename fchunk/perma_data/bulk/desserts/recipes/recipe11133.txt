Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch pie pan.    
Place the eggs, flour, milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract into a blender. Blend on high speed until the coconut has been finely chopped. Pour this mixture into the prepared pie pan; sprinkle with cinnamon.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack to room temperature; refrigerate until cold before serving.
