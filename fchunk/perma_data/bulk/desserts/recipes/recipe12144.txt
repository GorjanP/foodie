Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    
Combine flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves in a medium bowl; set aside.    
Beat butter, Stevia in the Raw(R), and 1/4 cup Sugar in the Raw(R) in a large bowl with mixer at medium high speed until well mixed. Beat in egg and corn syrup until smooth. Stir in flour mixture. Refrigerate dough 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle. (See Tip below.)    
Place 1/3 to 1/2 cup Sugar in the Raw(R) in a small dish. Shape dough into 3/4-inch balls; roll in sugar. Place balls 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets.    
Bake 7 to 10 minutes or just until edges begin to brown. (Do not overbake or cookies will be dry.) Cool 1 minute on baking sheet, then remove to wire racks to finish cooling.
