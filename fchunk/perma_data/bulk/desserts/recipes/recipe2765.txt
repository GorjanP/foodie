Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
In small bowl, stir together all crust ingredients.   Press on bottom and up sides of a 9-inch pie plate.  Bake for 8 minutes. Cool completely.    
Mash enough strawberries to equal 1 cup.  In 2-quart saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch.  Stir in mashed berries and water.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and  comes to a full boil (8 to 15 minutes). Boil 1 minute; remove from heat.    
Stir in salt and almond extract; cool 10 minutes.  Fill baked crust with remaining fresh strawberries; pour cooked mixture over fresh berries.  Refrigerate at least 3 hours.  Garnish with whipped cream and walnuts if desired.
