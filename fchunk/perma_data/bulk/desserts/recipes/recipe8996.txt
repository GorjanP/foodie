Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch round cake pan.    
Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, lemon zest, and ginger in a large bowl. Add the egg yolk, pumpkin puree, and oil; mix until smooth. Gently stir the egg whites into the batter; pour into prepared pan. Arrange the apple slices atop the batter; sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.    
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
