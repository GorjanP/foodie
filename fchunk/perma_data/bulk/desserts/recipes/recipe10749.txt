Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).    
Cover the bottoms of one 8-inch springform pan and one 9-inch spring form pan with parchment paper or grease and lightly flour.    
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a large measuring cup.    
Beat butter, sugar, eggs, strawberry extract, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl until smooth.    
Stir flour mixture, 1 cup at a time, and milk, 1/3 cup at a time, into butter mixture until a well-blended batter forms; stir strawberry puree into batter.    
Pour batter into prepared springform pans.    
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.
